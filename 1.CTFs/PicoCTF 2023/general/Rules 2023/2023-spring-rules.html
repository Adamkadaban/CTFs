students. The game consists of a series of challenges centered around a
unique storyline where participants must reverse engineer, break, hack,
decrypt, or do whatever it takes to solve the challenge. The challenges
are all set up with the intent of being hacked, making it an excellent,
legal way to get hands-on experience.</p>

  <li>be at least 13 years old;</li>
  <li>if under 18, have the consent of their parent or legal guardian to
participate;</li>
  <li>form a team alone or with up to 4 other Participants; and</li>
  <li>have a valid picoCTF account created through CMU’s picoCTF platform
(currently available at picoctf.org or https://picoctf.com)
    <ul>
      <li>Note: in order to create a picoCTF account, you will need to
provide certain information to register. If you are under 18, a
parent or legal guardian must provide their email address as
part of your account registration to indicate their consent to
your account registration, unless you have a student account
created by a teacher through a teacher batch registration.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-do-i-participate-in-the-competition">How do I participate in the Competition?</h2>

<p>To participate, you must have created your own individual picoCTF
account before or during the Competition Period and work on the
Competition challenges during some and/or all of the Competition Period.
If you are on a team with other Participants, each of you must have your
own valid picoCTF account. You may not share a picoCTF account with
another person.</p>

<p>You do not have to enter the Competition by the first day of the
Competition Period. However, the later you enter, the less time you have
to work on the challenges during the Competition Period. For clarity,
you cannot begin working on the Competition until you have a valid
picoCTF account.</p>

<p>NOTE: NOT EVERY PARTICIPANT IN THE COMPETITION IS ELIGIBLE TO WIN
PRIZES. PLEASE SEE DETAILS BELOW.</p>

<h2 id="collectionuse-of-your-information">Collection/Use of Your Information.</h2>

<p>As described in more detail below in these Competition Rules, CMU may
ask you for additional information to confirm that you are in compliance
with these Competition Rules and/or the Terms of Use and/or (if
applicable) that you are eligible to receive prizes in the Competition
(including but not limited to written verification of any necessary
parental consent). Please see our picoCTF Privacy Statement for
information about how we collect, use and disclose information you
provide.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-form-a-team">How do I form a Team?</h2>

<p>Each team is made up of 1-5 Participants (a “Team”). The registration
page will explain how you can invite others to join your Team (which may
involve use of a special invitation code).</p>

<p><strong>WHEN SELECTING A TEAM NAME, YOU MAY NOT INCLUDE ANY NAMES OR OTHER
PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IN YOUR TEAM NAME.</strong></p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-become-eligible-to-win-team-prizes">How do I become eligible to win Team prizes?</h2>

<p>In order to be eligible to compete for Team prizes, each Participant and
all other members of the Participant’s Team must: (i) be at least 13 but
younger than 20 and not have a high school diploma or GED; (ii) have
indicated in their registration that they are a middle or high school
student and resident in the US; and (iii) be enrolled in an accredited
United States middle school or high school (“School”) and/or be in the
process of being home-schooled at the middle or high school level in
compliance with the applicable home-schooling requirements of the
applicable student’s home state.</p>

<h2 id="how-are-the-winners-determined">How are the winners determined?</h2>

<p>The Team that solves the most problems within the allotted time will be
the winner. If more than one Team solves all of the problems, then the
Team that solved the problems in the shortest amount of time will be the
winner. As described in more detail below, winners (including any tie
breakers, questions about eligibility, etc.) are determined by CMU in
its sole discretion.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-team-prizes">What are the Team prizes?</h2>

<p>Subject to these Competition Rules and the Terms of Use, the Team prizes
will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1st place: $3,000 and may have opportunity to visit Carnegie Mellon
University's Pittsburgh campus for an award ceremony</li>
  <li>2nd place: $2,000 and may have opportunity to visit Carnegie Mellon
University's Pittsburgh campus for an award ceremony</li>
  <li>
    <p>3rd place: $1,000and may have opportunity to visit Carnegie Mellon
University's Pittsburgh campus for an award ceremony</p>
  </li>
  <li>Highest placing all middle school team: $500</li>
  <li>2nd highest placing all middle school team: $300</li>
  <li>3rd highest placing all middle school team: $150</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-are-the-other-rules-and-terms-for-picoctf-2023">What are the other rules and terms for picoCTF 2023?</h2>

<p>CMU may display one or more Competition leaderboards and/or scoreboards.
These boards may be available to other Participants and/or the public,
and may show the Team name, the country of residence and/or school
identified by the Team leader, and/or the name of the School identified
by the Team leader. <img src="/img/rules_fl23.png" alt="picoCTF{h34rd_und3r5700d_4ck_cba1c711}" /></p>

<p>While there are no limitations on the resources or tools that
Participants can use, only the eligible Team Participants may solve
challenges as part of the Competition. Team advisors, or anyone outside
the Team, may help facilitate the Team's work, such as by helping set
up tools or providing resources, but may not provide direct assistance
on any problems.</p>

<p>Teams may not interfere with the progress of other Teams, nor with the
operation of the Competition's infrastructure. More specifically,
attacking the scoring server, other Teams, or machines not explicitly
designated as targets is cheating. This includes both breaking into such
machines, and denying others access to them or the ability to solve
problems (for example, by altering a key or ping-flooding). Sharing keys
or providing overly-revealing hints with other teams is cheating, as is
being directly assisted by personnel outside the Team (using tools from
the internet is OK; asking people on the internet to help solve the
problem is not). We encourage Participants to solve problems in novel
and creative ways using all available resources, but we do require that
Participants solve the problems themselves.</p>

<p>You must comply with the picoCTF Terms of Use and these Competition
Rules. As a reminder, the Terms of Use include, among other things, a
description of prohibited conduct and limitations on liability and
damages.</p>

<p>Answers to problems including challenge write-ups may not be publicly
posted or otherwise shared with anyone outside of your Team members
until after the Competition is over.</p>

<p>All information provided to establish an account must be true and
correct. You are responsible for keeping such information up-to-date.
Failure to keep your account up-to-date may, among other things,
jeopardize your eligibility for prizes.</p>

<p>You are solely responsible for keeping your account names and passwords
confidential. You are responsible for activity that takes place under
your account (including but not limited to activity that may affect your
eligibility for prizes). If you believe that your account (or an account
you have created on behalf of your child or a student) has been or may
be compromised, you must notify CMU by contacting <a href="mailto:other@picoCTF.org">other@picoCTF.org</a> as
soon as possible.</p>

<p>If you register to be on a Team with other Participants, you understand
that information about you may be provided to other Team Participants.
In addition, you understand that your School may be informed about your
participation in picoCTF and/or may be asked to verify your enrollment
in order to verify your eligibility to receive prizes. To the extent
your School cannot legally release such information about you without
your consent and you do not provide such consent, you agree that you
and/or your Team may be ineligible for certain prizes if CMU cannot
verify your eligibility.</p>

<p>At any time, in the sole and absolute discretion of CMU, CMU shall be
entitled to disqualify a Participant and/or Team in the event of a
failure to meet relevant eligibility criteria or any other violation or
suspected violation of these Competition Rules and/or any Terms of Use
(including but not limited to cheating). In the event of a Participant’s
disqualification, CMU may also notify the Participant’s School.</p>

<p>CMU will determine participation eligibility, declare winners (including
but not limited to in the event of a tie), and award prizes in its sole
and absolute discretion. You agree that such decisions are final and are
not subject to review or reconsideration, and that Teams are not
entitled to be informed of other Teams’ results.</p>

<p>Winning Teams may be asked to produce written solutions for several
challenges before receiving prizes. Each Participant of a winning team
will need an adviser or faculty member at the Participant’s School to
serve as a point of contact.</p>

<p>CMU reserves the right to verify the identity and eligibility of all
Participants and Teams at any time. Without limiting the general nature
of the prior sentence, prior to (and as a condition of) awarding any
prizes, you agree that CMU in its sole and absolute discretion may
require additional paperwork to be executed by the relevant
Participants. This information could include, among other things,
written verification of parental consent (if applicable), verification
of information needed to confirm eligibility or compliance with these
Competition Rules and/or the Terms of Use, and information needed to
facilitate the provision of prizes, and all paperwork requested by CMU
to enable it to comply with all applicable state, federal and local tax
reporting (which may require the provision of social security numbers or
other personal information as needed). All paperwork must be returned
within seven (7) days of the date provided by CMU (or such other date
specified by CMU). All prizes will be net of any taxes that CMU is
required by law to withhold. To the extent permitted by law, all taxes
imposed on prizes are the sole responsibility of the winners. If a
potential winner fails to provide such documentation within the
timeframe required or fails to comply with such laws, the prize may be
forfeited and CMU may, in its discretion, select an alternate potential
winner.</p>

<p>In its sole discretion, Carnegie Mellon University may extend an
invitation to an awards ceremony at its Pittsburgh campus. Reimbursement
for travel expenses is currently expected to include a round-trip
domestic airline ticket (coach) to/from Pittsburgh, hotel accommodations
and ground transportation for each applicable Participant on the winning
Team, plus one adult chaperone for the Team. As determined by Carnegie
Mellon in its sole discretion, Carnegie Mellon may make direct
arrangements for such items and/or may reimburse the winning team
members and chaperone for their respective documented and reasonable and
customary, out –of-pocket expenses for such items. Any and all other
costs associated with attendance at the awards ceremony are the
responsibility of the relevant Participants and their chaperones.</p>

<p>For any cash prizes awarded to a Team involving more than one
Participant, each Participant shall be awarded an equal share of such
prize, which shall be paid in United States dollars. Carnegie Mellon
may, in its sole discretion, condition the payment of some or all of the
winning Team's cash prize on the Team attending the event at Carnegie
Mellon University.</p>

<p>Any prizes awarded are non-transferable, and any non-cash prizes are not
exchangeable for cash. CMU’s ability to offer any and all prizes is
subject to applicable laws and regulations.</p>

shall not be liable for any damages, losses or claims resulting from any

To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, neither CMU nor
picoCTF Parties are responsible for technical problems or technical
malfunction or other occurrences which may affect the operation of the

faulty computer, telephone, cable, satellite, network, electronic,
wireless or Internet connectivity or other online communication
problems; failure of any e-mail transmissions to be sent to or received;
lost, late, delayed or intercepted e-mail transmissions; inaccessibility
of the picoCTF 2023 web site or any third party service providers in
whole or in part for any reason; traffic congestions on the Internet or
the picoCTF 2023 site; and/or inaccessibility or unavailability of an
email account used in connection with picoCTF 2023). To the maximum
extent permitted under applicable law, you hereby release CMU and the
PicoCTF Parties from any and all claims, damages or liabilities arising
from or relating to participation in picoCTF 2023.</p>

<p>To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, you agree to

and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees resulting from any
actual or alleged violation of these Competition Rules by you and/or
your participation in the Competition.</p>

<p>These Competition Rules shall be enforceable to the maximum extent
permitted under applicable law. If any portion of this these Competition
Rules is determined by any court or governmental agency of competent
jurisdiction to violate applicable law or otherwise not to conform to
requirements of law, then the rest of these Competition Rules will
remain in effect and the parties will substitute a suitable and
equitable provision for the invalid/unenforceable provision in order to
carry out the original intent and purpose of the original Competition
Rules.</p>

obligations under these Competition Rules. Any attempted assignment,
delegation or transfer shall be void.</p>

<p>These Competition Rules and the Terms of Use and your picoCTF 2023
registration represent your entire agreement with CMU with respect to
picoCTF 2023.</p>
