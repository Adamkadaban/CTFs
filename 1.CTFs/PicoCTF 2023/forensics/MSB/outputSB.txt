abandoned in favour of thepresent undertaking what had long been a favourite project: that of anew edition of Shelton's "Don Quixote," which has now become a somewhatscarce book. There are some--and I confess myself to be one--for whomShelton's racy old version, with all its defects, has a charm that nomodern translation, however skilful or correct, could possess. Sheltonhad the inestimable advantage of belonging to the same generation asCervantes; "Don Quixote" had to him a vitality that only a contemporarycould feel; it cost him no dramatic effort to see things as Cervantessaw them; there is no anachronism in his language; he put the Spanishof Cervantes into the English of Shakespeare. Shakespeare himself mostlikely knew the book; he may have carried it home with him in hissaddle-bags to Stratford on one of his last journeys, and under themulberry tree at New Place joined hands with a kindred genius in itspages.But it was soon made plain to me that to hope for even a moderatepopularity for Shelton was vain. His fine old crusted English would, nodoubt, be relished by a minority, but it would be only by a minority.His warmest admirers must admit that he is not a satisfactoryrepresentative of Cervantes. His translation of the First Part was veryhastily made and was never revised by him. It has all the freshness andvigour, but also a full measure of the faults, of a hasty production.It is often very literal--barbarously literal frequently--but just asoften very loose. He had evidently a good colloquial knowledge ofSpanish, but apparently not much more. It never seems to occur to himthat the same translation of a word will not suit in every case.It is often said that we have no satisfactory translation of "DonQuixote." To those who are familiar with the original, it savours oftruism or platitude to say so, for in truth there can be no thoroughlysatisfactory translation of "Don Quixote" into English or any otherlanguage. It is not that the Spanish idioms are so utterlyunmanageable, or that the untranslatable words, numerous enough nodoubt, are so superabundant, but rather that the sententious tersenessto which the humour of the book owes its flavour is peculiar toSpanish, and can at best be only distantly imitated in any othertongue.The history of our English translations of "Don Quixote" isinstructive. Shelton's, the first in any language, was made,apparently, about 1608, but not published till 1612. This of course wasonly the First Part. It has been asserted that the Second, published in1620, is not the work of Shelton, but there is nothing to support theassertion save the fact that it has less spirit, less of what wegenerally understand by "go," about it than the first, which would beonly natural if the first were the work of a young man writing_currente calamo_, and the second that of a middle-aged man writing fora bookseller. On the other hand, it is closer and more literal, thestyle is the same, the very same translations, or mistranslations,occur in it, and it is extremely unlikely that a new translator would,by suppressing his name, have allowed Shelton to carry off the credit.In 1687 John Phillips, Milton's nephew, produced a "Don Quixote" "madeEnglish," he says, "according to the humour of our modern language."His "Quixote" is not so much a translation as a travesty, and atravesty that for coarseness, vulgarity, and buffoonery is almostunexampled even in the literature of that day.Ned Ward's "Life and Notable Adventures of Don Quixote, merrilytranslated into Hudibrastic Verse" (1700), can scarcely be reckoned atranslation, but it serves to show the light in which "Don Quixote" wasregarded at the time.A further illustration may be found in the version published in 1712 byPeter Motteux, who had then recently combined tea-dealing withliterature. It is described as "translated from the original by severalhands," but if so all Spanish flavour has entirely evaporated under themanipulation of the several hands. The flavour that it has, on theother hand, is distinctly Franco-cockney. Anyone who compares itcarefully with the original will have little doubt that it is aconcoction from Shelton and the French of Filleau de Saint Martin, ekedout by borrowings from Phillips, whose mode of treatment it adopts. Itis, to be sure, more decent and decorous, but it treats "Don Quixote"in the same fashion as a comic book that cannot be made too comic.To attempt to improve the humour of "Don Quixote" by an infusion ofcockney flippancy and facetiousness, as Motteux's operators did, is notmerely an impertinence like larding a sirloin of prize beef, but anabsolute falsification of the spirit of the book, and it is a proof ofthe uncritical way in which "Don Quixote" is generally read that thisworse than worthless translation--worthless as failing to represent,worse than worthless as misrepresenting--should have been favoured as ithas been.It had the effect, however, of bringing out a translation undertakenand executed in a very different spirit, that of Charles Jervas, theportrait painter, and friend of Pope, Swift, Arbuthnot, and Gay. Jervashas been allowed little credit for his work, indeed it may be saidnone, for it is known to the world in general as Jarvis's. It was notpublished until after his death, and the printers gave the nameaccording to the current pronunciation of the day. It has been the mostfreely used and the most freely abused of all the translations. It hasseen far more editions than any other, it is admitted on all hands tobe by far the most faithful, and yet nobody seems to have a good wordto say for it or for its author. Jervas no doubt prejudiced readersagainst himself in his preface, where among many true words aboutShelton, Stevens, and Motteux, he rashly and unjustly charges Sheltonwith having translated not from the Spanish, but from the Italianversion of Franciosini, which did not appear until ten years afterShelton's first volume. A suspicion of incompetence, too, seems to haveattached to him because he was by profession a painter and a mediocreone (though he has given us the best portrait we have of Swift), andthis may have been strengthened by Pope's remark that he "translated'Don Quixote' without understanding Spanish." He has been also chargedwith borrowing from Shelton, whom he disparaged. It is true that in afew difficult or obscure passages he has followed Shelton, and goneastray with him; but for one case of this sort, there are fifty wherehe is right and Shelton wrong. As for Pope's dictum, anyone whoexamines Jervas's version carefully, side by side with the original,will see that he was a sound Spanish scholar, incomparably a better onethan Shelton, except perhaps in mere colloquial Spanish. He was, infact, an honest, faithful, and painstaking translator, and he has lefta version which, whatever its shortcomings may be, is singularly freefrom errors and mistranslations.The charge against it is that it is stiff, dry--"wooden" in a word,--andno one can deny that there is a foundation for it. But it may bepleaded for Jervas that a good deal of this rigidity is due to hisabhorrence of the light, flippant, jocose style of his predecessors. Hewas one of the few, very few, translators that have shown anyapprehension of the unsmiling gravity which is the essence of Quixotichumour; it seemed to him a crime to bring Cervantes forward smirkingand grinning at his own good things, and to this may be attributed in agreat measure the ascetic abstinence from everything savouring ofliveliness which is the characteristic of his translation. In mostmodern editions, it should be observed, his style has been smoothed andsmartened, but without any reference to the original Spanish, so thatif he has been made to read more agreeably he has also been robbed ofhis chief merit of fidelity.Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one ofthese. At any rate it is plain that in its construction Jervas'stranslation was very freely drawn upon, and very little or probably noheed given to the original Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, "printed for the Translator," was an impudentimposture, being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of thewords, here and there, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) wasonly an abridgment like Florian's, but not so skilfully executed; andthe version published by Miss Smirke in 1818, to accompany herbrother's plates, was merely a patchwork production made out of formertranslations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be in everysense of the word impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had noteven seen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, and sincethen I may say vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted thetemptation which Mr. Duffield's reputation and comely volumes hold outto every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of "Don Quixote," itwill be seen that there are a good many people who, provided they getthe mere narrative with its full complement of facts, incidents, andadventures served up to them in a form that amuses them, care verylittle whether that form is the one in which Cervantes originallyshaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there are manywho desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as hetells it, so far at least as differences of idiom and circumstancespermit, and who will give a preference to the conscientious translator,even though he may have acquitted himself somewhat awkwardly.But after all there is no real antagonism between the two classes;there is no reason why what pleases the one should not please theother, or why a translator who makes it his aim to treat "Don Quixote"with the respect due to a great classic, should not be as acceptableeven to the careless reader as the one who treats it as a famous oldjest-book. It is not a question of caviare to the general, or, if itis, the fault rests with him who makes so. The method by whichCervantes won the ear of the Spanish people ought, mutatis mutandis, tobe equally effective with the great majority of English readers. At anyrate, even if there are readers to whom it is a matter of indifference,fidelity to the method is as much a part of the translator's duty asfidelity to the matter. If he can please all parties, so much thebetter; but his first duty is to those who look to him for as faithfula representation of his author as it is in his power to give them,faithful to the letter so long as fidelity is practicable, faithful tothe spirit so far as he can make it.My purpose here is not to dogmatise on the rules of translation, but toindicate those I have followed, or at least tried to the best of myability to follow, in the present instance. One which, it seems to me,cannot be too rigidly followed in translating "Don Quixote," is toavoid everything that savours of affectation. The book itself is,indeed, in one sense a protest against it, and no man abhorred it morethan Cervantes. For this reason, I think, any temptation to useantiquated or obsolete language should be resisted. It is after all anaffectation, and one for which there is no warrant or excuse. Spanishhas probably undergone less change since the seventeenth century thanany language in Europe, and by far the greater and certainly the bestpart of "Don Quixote" differs but little in language from thecolloquial Spanish of the present day. Except in the tales and DonQuixote's speeches, the translator who uses the simplest and plainesteveryday language will almost always be the one who approaches nearestto the original.Seeing that the story of "Don Quixote" and all its characters andincidents have now been for more than two centuries and a half familiaras household words in English mouths, it seems to me that the oldfamiliar names and phrases should not be changed without good reason.Of course a translator who holds that "Don Quixote" should receive thetreatment a great classic deserves, will feel himself bound by theinjunction laid upon the Morisco in Chap. IX not to omit or addanything.CERVANTESFour generations had laughed over "Don Quixote" before it occurred toanyone to ask, who and what manner of man was this Miguel de CervantesSaavedra whose name is on the title-page; and it was too late for asatisfactory answer to the question when it was proposed to add a lifeof the author to the London edition published at Lord Carteret'sinstance in 1738. All traces of the personality of Cervantes had bythat time disappeared. Any floating traditions that may once haveexisted, transmitted from men who had known him, had long since diedout, and of other record there was none; for the sixteenth andseventeenth centuries were incurious as to "the men of the time," areproach against which the nineteenth has, at any rate, secured itself,if it has produced no Shakespeare or Cervantes. All that Mayans ySiscar, to whom the task was entrusted, or any of those who followedhim, Rios, Pellicer, or Navarrete, could do was to eke out the fewallusions Cervantes makes to himself in his various prefaces with suchpieces of documentary evidence bearing upon his life as they couldfind.This, however, has been done by the last-named biographer to such goodpurpose that he has superseded all predecessors. Thoroughness is thechief characteristic of Navarrete's work. Besides sifting, testing, andmethodising with rare patience and judgment what had been previouslybrought to light, he left, as the saying is, no stone unturned underwhich anything to illustrate his subject might possibly be found.Navarrete has done all that industry and acumen could do, and it is nofault of his if he has not given us what we want. What Hallam says ofShakespeare may be applied to the almost parallel case of Cervantes:"It is not the register of his baptism, or the draft of his will, orthe orthography of his name that we seek; no letter of his writing, norecord of his conversation, no character of him drawn ... by acontemporary has been produced."It is only natural, therefore, that the biographers of Cervantes,forced to make brick without straw, should have recourse largely toconjecture, and that conjecture should in some instances come bydegrees to take the place of established fact. All that I propose to dohere is to separate what is matter of fact from what is matter ofconjecture, and leave it to the reader's judgment to decide whether thedata justify the inference or not.The men whose names by common consent stand in the front rank ofSpanish literature, Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Quevedo, Calderon,Garcilaso de la Vega, the Mendozas, Gongora, were all men of ancientfamilies, and, curiously, all, except the last, of families that tracedtheir origin to the same mountain district in the North of Spain. Thefamily of Cervantes is commonly said to have been of Galician origin,and unquestionably it was in possession of lands in Galicia at a veryearly date; but I think the balance of the evidence tends to show thatthe "solar," the original site of the family, was at Cervatos in thenorth-west corner of Old Castile, close to the junction of Castile,Leon, and the Asturias. As it happens, there is a complete history ofthe Cervantes family from the tenth century down to the seventeenthextant under the title of "Illustrious Ancestry, Glorious Deeds, andNoble Posterity of the Famous Nuno Alfonso, Alcaide of Toledo," writtenin 1648 by the industrious genealogist Rodrigo Mendez Silva, whoavailed himself of a manuscript genealogy by Juan de Mena, the poetlaureate and historiographer of John II.The origin of the name Cervantes is curious. Nuno Alfonso was almost asdistinguished in the struggle against the Moors in the reign of AlfonsoVII as the Cid had been half a century before in that of Alfonso VI,and was rewarded by divers grants of land in the neighbourhood ofToledo. On one of his acquisitions, about two leagues from the city, hebuilt himself a castle which he called Cervatos, because "he was lordof the solar of Cervatos in the Montana," as the mountain regionextending from the Basque Provinces to Leon was always called. At hisdeath in battle in 1143, the castle passed by his will to his sonAlfonso Munio, who, as territorial or local surnames were then cominginto vogue in place of the simple patronymic, took the additional nameof Cervatos. His eldest son Pedro succeeded him in the possession ofthe castle, and followed his example in adopting the name, anassumption at which the younger son, Gonzalo, seems to have takenumbrage.Everyone who has paid even a flying visit to Toledo will remember theruined castle that crowns the hill above the spot where the bridge ofAlcantara spans the gorge of the Tagus, and with its broken outline andcrumbling walls makes such an admirable pendant to the square solidAlcazar towering over the city roofs on the opposite side. It wasbuilt, or as some say restored, by Alfonso VI shortly after hisoccupation of Toledo in 1085, and called by him San Servando after aSpanish martyr, a name subsequently modified into San Servan (in whichform it appears in the "Poem of the Cid"), San Servantes, and SanCervantes: with regard to which last the "Handbook for Spain" warns itsreaders against the supposition that it has anything to do with theauthor of "Don Quixote." Ford, as all know who have taken him for acompanion and counsellor on the roads of Spain, is seldom wrong inmatters of literature or history. In this instance, however, he is inerror. It has everything to do with the author of "Don Quixote," for itis in fact these old walls that have given to Spain the name she isproudest of to-day. Gonzalo, above mentioned, it may be readilyconceived, did not relish the appropriation by his brother of a name towhich he himself had an equal right, for though nominally taken fromthe castle, it was in reality derived from the ancient territorialpossession of the family, and as a set-off, and to distinguish himself(diferenciarse) from his brother, he took as a surname the name of thecastle on the bank of the Tagus, in the building of which, according toa family tradition, his great-grandfather had a share.Both brothers founded families. The Cervantes branch had more tenacity;it sent offshoots in various directions, Andalusia, Estremadura,Galicia, and Portugal, and produced a goodly line of men distinguishedin the service of Church and State. Gonzalo himself, and apparently ason of his, followed Ferdinand III in the great campaign of 1236-48that gave Cordova and Seville to Christian Spain and penned up theMoors in the kingdom of Granada, and his descendants intermarried withsome of the noblest families of the Peninsula and numbered among themsoldiers, magistrates, and Church dignitaries, including at least twocardinal-archbishops.Of the line that settled in Andalusia, Deigo de Cervantes, Commander ofthe Order of Santiago, married Juana Avellaneda, daughter of Juan Ariasde Saavedra, and had several sons, of whom one was Gonzalo Gomez,Corregidor of Jerez and ancestor of the Mexican and Columbian branchesof the family; and another, Juan, whose son Rodrigo married Dona Leonorde Cortinas, and by her had four children, Rodrigo, Andrea, Luisa, andMiguel, our author.The pedigree of Cervantes is not without its bearing on "Don Quixote."A man who could look back upon an ancestry of genuine knights-errantextending from well-nigh the time of Pelayo to the siege of Granada waslikely to have a strong feeling on the subject of the sham chivalry ofthe romances. It gives a point, too, to what he says in more than oneplace about families that have once been great and have tapered awayuntil they have come to nothing, like a pyramid. It was the case of hisown.He was born at Alcala de Henares and baptised in the church of SantaMaria Mayor on the 9th of October, 1547. Of his boyhood and youth weknow nothing, unless it be from the glimpse he gives us in the prefaceto his "Comedies" of himself as a boy looking on with delight whileLope de Rueda and his company set up their rude plank stage in theplaza and acted the rustic farces which he himself afterwards took asthe model of his interludes. This first glimpse, however, is asignificant one, for it shows the early development of that love of thedrama which exercised such an influence on his life and seems to havegrown stronger as he grew older, and of which this very preface,written only a few months before his death, is such a striking proof.He gives us to understand, too, that he was a great reader in hisyouth; but of this no assurance was needed, for the First Part of "DonQuixote" alone proves a vast amount of miscellaneous reading, romancesof chivalry, ballads, popular poetry, chronicles, for which he had notime or opportunity except in the first twenty years of his life; andhis misquotations and mistakes in matters of detail are always, it maybe noticed, those of a man recalling the reading of his boyhood.Other things besides the drama were in their infancy when Cervantes wasa boy. The period of his boyhood was in every way a transition periodfor Spain. The old chivalrous Spain had passed away. The new Spain wasthe mightiest power the world had seen since the Roman Empire and ithad not yet been called upon to pay the price of its greatness. By thepolicy of Ferdinand and Ximenez the sovereign had been made absolute,and the Church and Inquisition adroitly adjusted to keep him so. Thenobles, who had always resisted absolutism as strenuously as they hadfought the Moors, had been divested of all political power, a like fatehad befallen the cities, the free constitutions of Castile and Aragonhad been swept away, and the only function that remained to the Corteswas that of granting money at the King's dictation.The transition extended to literature. Men who, like Garcilaso de laVega and Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, followed the Italian wars, hadbrought back from Italy the products of the post-Renaissanceliterature, which took root and flourished and even threatened toextinguish the native growths. Damon and Thyrsis, Phyllis and Chloe hadbeen fairly naturalised in Spain, together with all the devices ofpastoral poetry for investing with an air of novelty the idea of adispairing shepherd and inflexible shepherdess. As a set-off againstthis, the old historical and traditional ballads, and the truepastorals, the songs and ballads of peasant life, were being collectedassiduously and printed in the cancioneros that succeeded one anotherwith increasing rapidity. But the most notable consequence, perhaps, ofthe spread of printing was the flood of romances of chivalry that hadcontinued to pour from the press ever since Garci Ordonez de Montalvohad resuscitated "Amadis of Gaul" at the beginning of the century.For a youth fond of reading, solid or light, there could have been nobetter spot in Spain than Alcala de Henares in the middle of thesixteenth century. It was then a busy, populous university town,something more than the enterprising rival of Salamanca, and altogethera very different place from the melancholy, silent, deserted Alcala thetraveller sees now as he goes from Madrid to Saragossa. Theology andmedicine may have been the strong points of the university, but thetown itself seems to have inclined rather to the humanities and lightliterature, and as a producer of books Alcala was already beginning tocompete with the older presses of Toledo, Burgos, Salamanca andSeville.A pendant to the picture Cervantes has given us of his first playgoingsmight, no doubt, have been often seen in the streets of Alcala at thattime; a bright, eager, tawny-haired boy peering into a book-shop wherethe latest volumes lay open to tempt the public, wondering, it may be,what that little book with the woodcut of the blind beggar and his boy,that called itself "Vida de Lazarillo de Tormes, segunda impresion,"could be about; or with eyes brimming over with merriment gazing at oneof those preposterous portraits of a knight-errant in outrageouspanoply and plumes with which the publishers of chivalry romances lovedto embellish the title-pages of their folios. If the boy was the fatherof the man, the sense of the incongruous that was strong at fifty waslively at ten, and some such reflections as these may have been thetrue genesis of "Don Quixote."For his more solid education, we are told, he went to Salamanca. Butwhy Rodrigo de Cervantes, who was very poor, should have sent his sonto a university a hundred and fifty miles away when he had one at hisown door, would be a puzzle, if we had any reason for supposing that hedid so. The only evidence is a vague statement by Professor TomasGonzalez, that he once saw an old entry of the matriculation of aMiguel de Cervantes. This does not appear to have been ever seen again;but even if it had, and if the date corresponded, it would provenothing, as there were at least two other Miguels born about the middleof the century; one of them, moreover, a Cervantes Saavedra, a cousin,no doubt, who was a source of great embarrassment to the biographers.That he was a student neither at Salamanca nor at Alcala is best provedby his own works. No man drew more largely upon experience than he did,and he has nowhere left a single reminiscence of student life--for the"Tia Fingida," if it be his, is not one--nothing, not even "a collegejoke," to show that he remembered days that most men remember best. Allthat we know positively about his education is that Juan Lopez deHoyos, a professor of humanities and belles-lettres of some eminence,calls him his "dear and beloved pupil." This was in a little collectionof verses by different hands on the death of Isabel de Valois, secondqueen of Philip II., published by the professor in 1569, to whichCervantes contributed four pieces, including an elegy, and an epitaphin the form of a sonnet. It is only by a rare chance that a "Lycidas"finds its way into a volume of this sort, and Cervantes was no Milton.His verses are no worse than such things usually are; so much, atleast, may be said for them.By the time the book appeared he had left Spain, and, as fate orderedit, for twelve years, the most eventful ones of his life. Giulio,afterwards Cardinal, Acquaviva had been sent at the end of 1568 toPhilip II. by the Pope on a mission, partly of condolence, partlypolitical, and on his return to Rome, which was somewhat brusquelyexpedited by the King, he took Cervantes with him as his camarero(chamberlain), the office he himself held in the Pope's household. Thepost would no doubt have led to advancement at the Papal Court hadCervantes retained it, but in the summer of 1570 he resigned it andenlisted as a private soldier in Captain Diego Urbina's company,belonging to Don Miguel de Moncada's regiment, but at that time forminga part of the command of Marc Antony Colonna. What impelled him to thisstep we know not, whether it was distaste for the career before him, orpurely military enthusiasm. It may well have been the latter, for itwas a stirring time; the events, however, which led to the alliancebetween Spain, Venice, and the Pope, against the common enemy, thePorte, and to the victory of the combined fleets at Lepanto, belongrather to the history of Europe than to the life of Cervantes. He wasone of those that sailed from Messina, in September 1571, under thecommand of Don John of Austria; but on the morning of the 7th ofOctober, when the Turkish fleet was sighted, he was lying below illwith fever. At the news that the enemy was in sight he rose, and, inspite of the remonstrances of his comrades and superiors, insisted ontaking his post, saying he preferred death in the service of God andthe King to health. His galley, the _Marquesa_, was in the thick of thefight, and before it was over he had received three gunshot wounds, twoin the breast and one in the left hand or arm. On the morning after thebattle, according to Navarrete, he had an interview with thecommander-in-chief, Don John, who was making a personal inspection ofthe wounded, one result of which was an addition of three crowns to hispay, and another, apparently, the friendship of his general.How severely Cervantes was wounded may be inferred from the fact, thatwith youth, a vigorous frame, and as cheerful and buoyant a temperamentas ever invalid had, he was seven months in hospital at Messina beforehe was discharged. He came out with his left hand permanently disabled;he had lost the use of it, as Mercury told him in the "Viaje delParnaso" for the greater glory of the right. This, however, did notabsolutely unfit him for service, and in April 1572 he joined ManuelPonce de Leon's company of Lope de Figueroa's regiment, in which, itseems probable, his brother Rodrigo was serving, and shared in theoperations of the next three years, including the capture of theGoletta and Tunis. Taking advantage of the lull which followed therecapture of these places by the Turks, he obtained leave to return toSpain, and sailed from Naples in September 1575 on board the _Sun_galley, in company with his brother Rodrigo, Pedro Carrillo de Quesada,late Governor of the Goletta, and some others, and furnished withletters from Don John of Austria and the Duke of Sesa, the Viceroy ofSicily, recommending him to the King for the command of a company, onaccount of his services; a _dono infelice_ as events proved. On the26th they fell in with a squadron of Algerine galleys, and after astout resistance were overpowered and carried into Algiers.By means of a ransomed fellow-captive the brothers contrived to informtheir family of their condition, and the poor people at Alcala at oncestrove to raise the ransom money, the father disposing of all hepossessed, and the two sisters giving up their marriage portions. ButDali Mami had found on Cervantes the letters addressed to the King byDon John and the Duke of Sesa, and, concluding that his prize must be aperson of great consequence, when the money came he refused itscornfully as being altogether insufficient. The owner of Rodrigo,however, was more easily satisfied; ransom was accepted in his case,and it was arranged between the brothers that he should return to Spainand procure a vessel in which he was to come back to Algiers and takeoff Miguel and as many of their comrades as possible. This was not thefirst attempt to escape that Cervantes had made. Soon after thecommencement of his captivity he induced several of his companions tojoin him in trying to reach Oran, then a Spanish post, on foot; butafter the first day's journey, the Moor who had agreed to act as theirguide deserted them, and they had no choice but to return. The secondattempt was more disastrous. In a garden outside the city on thesea-shore, he constructed, with the help of the gardener, a Spaniard, ahiding-place, to which he brought, one by one, fourteen of hisfellow-captives, keeping them there in secrecy for several months, andsupplying them with food through a renegade known as El Dorador, "theGilder." How he, a captive himself, contrived to do all this, is one ofthe mysteries of the story. Wild as the project may appear, it was verynearly successful. The vessel procured by Rodrigo made its appearanceoff the coast, and under cover of night was proceeding to take off therefugees, when the crew were alarmed by a passing fishing boat, andbeat a hasty retreat. On renewing the attempt shortly afterwards, they,or a portion of them at least, were taken prisoners, and just as thepoor fellows in the garden were exulting in the thought that in a fewmoments more freedom would be within their grasp, they found themselvessurrounded by Turkish troops, horse and foot. The Dorador had revealedthe whole scheme to the Dey Hassan.When Cervantes saw what had befallen them, he charged his companions tolay all the blame upon him, and as they were being bound he declaredaloud that the whole plot was of his contriving, and that nobody elsehad any share in it. Brought before the Dey, he said the same. He wasthreatened with impalement and with torture; and as cutting off earsand noses were playful freaks with the Algerines, it may be conceivedwhat their tortures were like; but nothing could make him swerve fromhis original statement that he and he alone was responsible. The upshotwas that the unhappy gardener was hanged by his master, and theprisoners taken possession of by the Dey, who, however, afterwardsrestored most of them to their masters, but kept Cervantes, paying DaliMami 500 crowns for him. He felt, no doubt, that a man of suchresource, energy, and daring, was too dangerous a piece of property tobe left in private hands; and he had him heavily ironed and lodged inhis own prison. If he thought that by these means he could break thespirit or shake the resolution of his prisoner, he was soon undeceived,for Cervantes contrived before long to despatch a letter to theGovernor of Oran, entreating him to send him someone that could betrusted, to enable him and three other gentlemen, fellow-captives ofhis, to make their escape; intending evidently to renew his firstattempt with a more trustworthy guide. Unfortunately the Moor whocarried the letter was stopped just outside Oran, and the letter beingfound upon him, he was sent back to Algiers, where by the order of theDey he was promptly impaled as a warning to others, while Cervantes wascondemned to receive two thousand blows of the stick, a number whichmost likely would have deprived the world of "Don Quixote," had notsome persons, who they were we know not, interceded on his behalf.After this he seems to have been kept in still closer confinement thanbefore, for nearly two years passed before he made another attempt.This time his plan was to purchase, by the aid of a Spanish renegadeand two Valencian merchants resident in Algiers, an armed vessel inwhich he and about sixty of the leading captives were to make theirescape; but just as they were about to put it into execution one DoctorJuan Blanco de Paz, an ecclesiastic and a compatriot, informed the Deyof the plot. Cervantes by force of character, by his self-devotion, byhis untiring energy and his exertions to lighten the lot of hiscompanions in misery, had endeared himself to all, and become theleading spirit in the captive colony, and, incredible as it may seem,jealousy of his influence and the esteem in which he was held, movedthis man to compass his destruction by a cruel death. The merchantsfinding that the Dey knew all, and fearing that Cervantes under torturemight make disclosures that would imperil their own lives, tried topersuade him to slip away on board a vessel that was on the point ofsailing for Spain; but he told them they had nothing to fear, for notortures would make him compromise anybody, and he went at once andgave himself up to the Dey.As before, the Dey tried to force him to name his accomplices.Everything was made ready for his immediate execution; the halter wasput round his neck and his hands tied behind him, but all that could begot from him was that he himself, with the help of four gentlemen whohad since left Algiers, had arranged the whole, and that the sixty whowere to accompany him were not to know anything of it until the lastmoment. Finding he could make nothing of him, the Dey sent him back toprison more heavily ironed than before.The poverty-stricken Cervantes family had been all this time tryingonce more to raise the ransom money, and at last a sum of three hundredducats was got together and entrusted to the Redemptorist Father JuanGil, who was about to sail for Algiers. The Dey, however, demanded morethan double the sum offered, and as his term of office had expired andhe was about to sail for Constantinople, taking all his slaves withhim, the case of Cervantes was critical. He was already on boardheavily ironed, when the Dey at length agreed to reduce his demand byone-half, and Father Gil by borrowing was able to make up the amount,and on September 19, 1580, after a captivity of five years all but aweek, Cervantes was at last set free. Before long he discovered thatBlanco de Paz, who claimed to be an officer of the Inquisition, was nowconcocting on false evidence a charge of misconduct to be broughtagainst him on his return to Spain. To checkmate him Cervantes drew upa series of twenty-five questions, covering the whole period of hiscaptivity, upon which he requested Father Gil to take the depositionsof credible witnesses before a notary. Eleven witnesses taken fromamong the principal captives in Algiers deposed to all the facts abovestated and to a great deal more besides. There is something touching inthe admiration, love, and gratitude we see struggling to findexpression in the formal language of the notary, as they testify oneafter another to the good deeds of Cervantes, how he comforted andhelped the weak-hearted, how he kept up their drooping courage, how heshared his poor purse with this deponent, and how "in him this deponentfound father and mother."On his return to Spain he found his old regiment about to march forPortugal to support Philip's claim to the crown, and utterly pennilessnow, had no choice but to rejoin it. He was in the expeditions to theAzores in 1582 and the following year, and on the conclusion of the warreturned to Spain in the autumn of 1583, bringing with him themanuscript of his pastoral romance, the "Galatea," and probably also,to judge by internal evidence, that of the first portion of "Persilesand Sigismunda." He also brought back with him, his biographers assert,an infant daughter, the offspring of an amour, as some of them withgreat circumstantiality inform us, with a Lisbon lady of noble birth,whose name, however, as well as that of the street she lived in, theyomit to mention. The sole foundation for all this is that in 1605 therecertainly was living in the family of Cervantes a Dona Isabel deSaavedra, who is described in an official document as his naturaldaughter, and then twenty years of age.With his crippled left hand promotion in the army was hopeless, nowthat Don John was dead and he had no one to press his claims andservices, and for a man drawing on to forty life in the ranks was adismal prospect; he had already a certain reputation as a poet; he madeup his mind, therefore, to cast his lot with literature, and for afirst venture committed his "Galatea" to the press. It was published,as Salva y Mallen shows conclusively, at Alcala, his own birth-place,in 1585 and no doubt helped to make his name more widely known, butcertainly did not do him much good in any other way.While it was going through the press, he married Dona Catalina dePalacios Salazar y Vozmediano, a lady of Esquivias near Madrid, andapparently a friend of the family, who brought him a fortune which maypossibly have served to keep the wolf from the door, but if so, thatwas all. The drama had by this time outgrown market-place stages andstrolling companies, and with his old love for it he naturally turnedto it for a congenial employment. In about three years he wrote twentyor thirty plays, which he tells us were performed without any throwingof cucumbers or other missiles, and ran their course without anyhisses, outcries, or disturbance. In other words, his plays were notbad enough to be hissed off the stage, but not good enough to holdtheir own upon it. Only two of them have been preserved, but as theyhappen to be two of the seven or eight he mentions with complacency, wemay assume they are favourable specimens, and no one who reads the"Numancia" and the "Trato de Argel" will feel any surprise that theyfailed as acting dramas. Whatever merits they may have, whateveroccasional they may show, they are, as regards construction, incurablyclumsy. How completely they failed is manifest from the fact that withall his sanguine temperament and indomitable perseverance he was unableto maintain the struggle to gain a livelihood as a dramatist for morethan three years; nor was the rising popularity of Lope the cause, asis often said, notwithstanding his own words to the contrary. When Lopebegan to write for the stage is uncertain, but it was certainly afterCervantes went to Seville.Among the "Nuevos Documentos" printed by Senor Asensio y Toledo is onedated 1592, and curiously characteristic of Cervantes. It is anagreement with one Rodrigo Osorio, a manager, who was to accept sixcomedies at fifty ducats (about 6l.) apiece, not to be paid in any caseunless it appeared on representation that the said comedy was one ofthe best that had ever been represented in Spain. The test does notseem to have been ever applied; perhaps it was sufficiently apparent toRodrigo Osorio that the comedies were not among the best that had everbeen represented. Among the correspondence of Cervantes there mighthave been found, no doubt, more than one letter like that we see in the"Rake's Progress," "Sir, I have read your play, and it will not doo."He was more successful in a literary contest at Saragossa in 1595 inhonour of the canonisation of St. Jacinto, when his composition won thefirst prize, three silver spoons. The year before this he had beenappointed a collector of revenues for the kingdom of Granada. In orderto remit the money he had collected more conveniently to the treasury,he entrusted it to a merchant, who failed and absconded; and as thebankrupt's assets were insufficient to cover the whole, he was sent toprison at Seville in September 1597. The balance against him, however,was a small one, about 26l., and on giving security for it he wasreleased at the end of the year.It was as he journeyed from town to town collecting the king's taxes,that he noted down those bits of inn and wayside life and characterthat abound in the pages of "Don Quixote:" the Benedictine monks withspectacles and sunshades, mounted on their tall mules; the strollers incostume bound for the next village; the barber with his basin on hishead, on his way to bleed a patient; the recruit with his breeches inhis bundle, tramping along the road singing; the reapers gathered inthe venta gateway listening to "Felixmarte of Hircania" read out tothem; and those little Hogarthian touches that he so well knew how tobring in, the ox-tail hanging up with the landlord's comb stuck in it,the wine-skins at the bed-head, and those notable examples of hostelryart, Helen going off in high spirits on Paris's arm, and Dido on thetower dropping tears as big as walnuts. Nay, it may well be that onthose journeys into remote regions he came across now and then aspecimen of the pauper gentleman, with his lean hack and his greyhoundand his books of chivalry, dreaming away his life in happy ignorancethat the world had changed since his great-grandfather's old helmet wasnew. But it was in Seville that he found out his true vocation, thoughhe himself would not by any means have admitted it to be so. It wasthere, in Triana, that he was first tempted to try his hand at drawingfrom life, and first brought his humour into play in the exquisitelittle sketch of "Rinconete y Cortadillo," the germ, in more ways thanone, of "Don Quixote."Where and when that was written, we cannot tell. After his imprisonmentall trace of Cervantes in his official capacity disappears, from whichit may be inferred that he was not reinstated. That he was still inSeville in November 1598 appears from a satirical sonnet of his on theelaborate catafalque erected to testify the grief of the city at thedeath of Philip II, but from this up to 1603 we have no clue to hismovements. The words in the preface to the First Part of "Don Quixote"are generally held to be conclusive that he conceived the idea of thebook, and wrote the beginning of it at least, in a prison, and that hemay have done so is extremely likely.There is a tradition that Cervantes read some portions of his work to aselect audience at the Duke of Bejar's, which may have helped to makethe book known; but the obvious conclusion is that the First Part of"Don Quixote" lay on his hands some time before he could find apublisher bold enough to undertake a venture of so novel a character;and so little faith in it had Francisco Robles of Madrid, to whom atlast he sold it, that he did not care to incur the expense of securingthe copyright for Aragon or Portugal, contenting himself with that forCastile. The printing was finished in December, and the book came outwith the new year, 1605. It is often said that "Don Quixote" was atfirst received coldly. The facts show just the contrary. No sooner wasit in the hands of the public than preparations were made to issuepirated editions at Lisbon and Valencia, and to bring out a secondedition with the additional copyrights for Aragon and Portugal, whichhe secured in February.No doubt it was received with something more than coldness by certainsections of the community. Men of wit, taste, and discrimination amongthe aristocracy gave it a hearty welcome, but the aristocracy ingeneral were not likely to relish a book that turned their favouritereading into ridicule and laughed at so many of their favourite ideas.The dramatists who gathered round Lope as their leader regardedCervantes as their common enemy, and it is plain that he was equallyobnoxious to the other clique, the culto poets who had Gongora fortheir chief. Navarrete, who knew nothing of the letter above mentioned,tries hard to show that the relations between Cervantes and Lope wereof a very friendly sort, as indeed they were until "Don Quixote" waswritten. Cervantes, indeed, to the last generously and manfullydeclared his admiration of Lope's powers, his unfailing invention, andhis marvellous fertility; but in the preface of the First Part of "DonQuixote" and in the verses of "Urganda the Unknown," and one or twoother places, there are, if we read between the lines, sly hits atLope's vanities and affectations that argue no personal good-will; andLope openly sneers at "Don Quixote" and Cervantes, and fourteen yearsafter his death gives him only a few lines of cold commonplace in the"Laurel de Apolo," that seem all the colder for the eulogies of a hostof nonentities whose names are found nowhere else.In 1601 Valladolid was made the seat of the Court, and at the beginningof 1603 Cervantes had been summoned thither in connection with thebalance due by him to the Treasury, which was still outstanding. Heremained at Valladolid, apparently supporting himself by agencies andscrivener's work of some sort; probably drafting petitions and drawingup statements of claims to be presented to the Council, and the like.So, at least, we gather from the depositions taken on the occasion ofthe death of a gentleman, the victim of a street brawl, who had beencarried into the house in which he lived. In these he himself isdescribed as a man who wrote and transacted business, and it appearsthat his household then consisted of his wife, the natural daughterIsabel de Saavedra already mentioned, his sister Andrea, now a widow,her daughter Constanza, a mysterious Magdalena de Sotomayor callingherself his sister, for whom his biographers cannot account, and aservant-maid.Meanwhile "Don Quixote" had been growing in favour, and its author'sname was now known beyond the Pyrenees. In 1607 an edition was printedat Brussels. Robles, the Madrid publisher, found it necessary to meetthe demand by a third edition, the seventh in all, in 1608. Thepopularity of the book in Italy was such that a Milan bookseller wasled to bring out an edition in 1610; and another was called for inBrussels in 1611. It might naturally have been expected that, with suchproofs before him that he had hit the taste of the public, Cervanteswould have at once set about redeeming his rather vague promise of asecond volume.But, to all appearance, nothing was farther from his thoughts. He hadstill by him one or two short tales of the same vintage as those he hadinserted in "Don Quixote" and instead of continuing the adventures ofDon Quixote, he set to work to write more of these "Novelas Exemplares"as he afterwards called them, with a view to making a book of them.The novels were published in the summer of 1613, with a dedication tothe Conde de Lemos, the Maecenas of the day, and with one of thosechatty confidential prefaces Cervantes was so fond of. In this, eightyears and a half after the First Part of "Don Quixote" had appeared, weget the first hint of a forthcoming Second Part. "You shall seeshortly," he says, "the further exploits of Don Quixote and humours ofSancho Panza." His idea of "shortly" was a somewhat elastic one, for,as we know by the date to Sancho's letter, he had barely one-half ofthe book completed that time twelvemonth.But more than poems, or pastorals, or novels, it was his dramaticambition that engrossed his thoughts. The same indomitable spirit thatkept him from despair in the bagnios of Algiers, and prompted him toattempt the escape of himself and his comrades again and again, madehim persevere in spite of failure and discouragement in his efforts towin the ear of the public as a dramatist. The temperament of Cervanteswas essentially sanguine. The portrait he draws in the preface to thenovels, with the aquiline features, chestnut hair, smooth untroubledforehead, and bright cheerful eyes, is the very portrait of a sanguineman. Nothing that the managers might say could persuade him that themerits of his plays would not be recognised at last if they were onlygiven a fair chance. The old soldier of the Spanish Salamis was bent onbeing the Aeschylus of Spain. He was to found a great national drama,based on the true principles of art, that was to be the envy of allnations; he was to drive from the stage the silly, childish plays, the"mirrors of nonsense and models of folly" that were in vogue throughthe cupidity of the managers and shortsightedness of the authors; hewas to correct and educate the public taste until it was ripe fortragedies on the model of the Greek drama--like the "Numancia" forinstance--and comedies that would not only amuse but improve andinstruct. All this he was to do, could he once get a hearing: there wasthe initial difficulty.He shows plainly enough, too, that "Don Quixote" and the demolition ofthe chivalry romances was not the work that lay next his heart. He was,indeed, as he says himself in his preface, more a stepfather than afather to "Don Quixote." Never was great work so neglected by itsauthor. That it was written carelessly, hastily, and by fits andstarts, was not always his fault, but it seems clear he never read whathe sent to the press. He knew how the printers had blundered, but henever took the trouble to correct them when the third edition was inprogress, as a man who really cared for the child of his brain wouldhave done. He appears to have regarded the book as little more than amere libro de entretenimiento, an amusing book, a thing, as he says inthe "Viaje," "to divert the melancholy moody heart at any time orseason." No doubt he had an affection for his hero, and was very proudof Sancho Panza. It would have been strange indeed if he had not beenproud of the most humorous creation in all fiction. He was proud, too,of the popularity and success of the book, and beyond measuredelightful is the naivete with which he shows his pride in a dozenpassages in the Second Part. But it was not the success he coveted. Inall probability he would have given all the success of "Don Quixote,"nay, would have seen every copy of "Don Quixote" burned in the PlazaMayor, for one such success as Lope de Vega was enjoying on an averageonce a week.And so he went on, dawdling over "Don Quixote," adding a chapter nowand again, and putting it aside to turn to "Persiles andSigismunda"--which, as we know, was to be the most entertaining book inthe language, and the rival of "Theagenes and Chariclea"--or finishingoff one of his darling comedies; and if Robles asked when "Don Quixote"would be ready, the answer no doubt was: En breve--shortly, there wastime enough for that. At sixty-eight he was as full of life and hopeand plans for the future as a boy of eighteen.Nemesis was coming, however. He had got as far as Chapter LIX, which athis leisurely pace he could hardly have reached before October orNovember 1614, when there was put into his hand a small octave latelyprinted at Tarragona, and calling itself "Second Volume of theIngenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha: by the Licentiate AlonsoFernandez de Avellaneda of Tordesillas." The last half of Chapter LIXand most of the following chapters of the Second Part give us some ideaof the effect produced upon him, and his irritation was not likely tobe lessened by the reflection that he had no one to blame but himself.Had Avellaneda, in fact, been content with merely bringing out acontinuation to "Don Quixote," Cervantes would have had no reasonablegrievance. His own intentions were expressed in the very vaguestlanguage at the end of the book; nay, in his last words, "forse altrocantera con miglior plettro," he seems actually to invite someone elseto continue the work, and he made no sign until eight years and a halfhad gone by; by which time Avellaneda's volume was no doubt written.In fact Cervantes had no case, or a very bad one, as far as the merecontinuation was concerned. But Avellaneda chose to write a preface toit, full of such coarse personal abuse as only an ill-conditioned mancould pour out. He taunts Cervantes with being old, with having losthis hand, with having been in prison, with being poor, with beingfriendless, accuses him of envy of Lope's success, of petulance andquerulousness, and so on; and it was in this that the sting lay.Avellaneda's reason for this personal attack is obvious enough. Whoeverhe may have been, it is clear that he was one of the dramatists ofLope's school, for he has the impudence to charge Cervantes withattacking him as well as Lope in his criticism on the drama. Hisidentification has exercised the best critics and baffled all theingenuity and research that has been brought to bear on it. Navarreteand Ticknor both incline to the belief that Cervantes knew who he was;but I must say I think the anger he shows suggests an invisibleassailant; it is like the irritation of a man stung by a mosquito inthe dark. Cervantes from certain solecisms of language pronounces himto be an Aragonese, and Pellicer, an Aragonese himself, supports thisview and believes him, moreover, to have been an ecclesiastic, aDominican probably.Any merit Avellaneda has is reflected from Cervantes, and he is toodull to reflect much. "Dull and dirty" will always be, I imagine, theverdict of the vast majority of unprejudiced readers. He is, at best, apoor plagiarist; all he can do is to follow slavishly the lead givenhim by Cervantes; his only humour lies in making Don Quixote take innsfor castles and fancy himself some legendary or historical personage,and Sancho mistake words, invert proverbs, and display his gluttony;all through he shows a proclivity to coarseness and dirt, and he hascontrived to introduce two tales filthier than anything by thesixteenth century novellieri and without their sprightliness.But whatever Avellaneda and his book may be, we must not forget thedebt we owe them. But for them, there can be no doubt, "Don Quixote"would have come to us a mere torso instead of a complete work. Even ifCervantes had finished the volume he had in hand, most assuredly hewould have left off with a promise of a Third Part, giving the furtheradventures of Don Quixote and humours of Sancho Panza as shepherds. Itis plain that he had at one time an intention of dealing with thepastoral romances as he had dealt with the books of chivalry, and butfor Avellaneda he would have tried to carry it out. But it is morelikely that, with his plans, and projects, and hopefulness, the volumewould have remained unfinished till his death, and that we should havenever made the acquaintance of the Duke and Duchess, or gone withSancho to Barataria.From the moment the book came into his hands he seems to have beenhaunted by the fear that there might be more Avellanedas in the field,and putting everything else aside, he set himself to finish off histask and protect Don Quixote in the only way he could, by killing him.The conclusion is no doubt a hasty and in some places clumsy piece ofwork and the frequent repetition of the scolding administered toAvellaneda becomes in the end rather wearisome; but it is, at any rate,a conclusion and for that we must thank Avellaneda.The new volume was ready for the press in February, but was not printedtill the very end of 1615, and during the interval Cervantes puttogether the comedies and interludes he had written within the last fewyears, and, as he adds plaintively, found no demand for among themanagers, and published them with a preface, worth the book itintroduces tenfold, in which he gives an account of the early Spanishstage, and of his own attempts as a dramatist. It is needless to saythey were put forward by Cervantes in all good faith and fullconfidence in their merits. The reader, however, was not to supposethey were his last word or final effort in the drama, for he had inhand a comedy called "Engano a los ojos," about which, if he mistooknot, there would be no question.Of this dramatic masterpiece the world has no opportunity of judging;his health had been failing for some time, and he died, apparently ofdropsy, on the 23rd of April, 1616, the day on which England lostShakespeare, nominally at least, for the English calendar had not yetbeen reformed. He died as he had lived, accepting his lot bravely andcheerfully.Was it an unhappy life, that of Cervantes? His biographers all tell usthat it was; but I must say I doubt it. It was a hard life, a life ofpoverty, of incessant struggle, of toil ill paid, of disappointment,but Cervantes carried within himself the antidote to all these evils.His was not one of those light natures that rise above adversity merelyby virtue of their own buoyancy; it was in the fortitude of a highspirit that he was proof against it. It is impossible to conceiveCervantes giving way to despondency or prostrated by dejection. As forpoverty, it was with him a thing to be laughed over, and the only sighhe ever allows to escape him is when he says, "Happy he to whom Heavenhas given a piece of bread for which he is not bound to give thanks toany but Heaven itself." Add to all this his vital energy and mentalactivity, his restless invention and his sanguine temperament, andthere will be reason enough to doubt whether his could have been a veryunhappy life. He who could take Cervantes' distresses together with hisapparatus for enduring them would not make so bad a bargain, perhaps,as far as happiness in life is concerned.Of his burial-place nothing is known except that he was buried, inaccordance with his will, in the neighbouring convent of Trinitariannuns, of which it is supposed his daughter, Isabel de Saavedra, was aninmate, and that a few years afterwards the nuns removed to anotherconvent, carrying their dead with them. But whether the remains ofCervantes were included in the removal or not no one knows, and theclue to their resting-place is now lost beyond all hope. This furnishesperhaps the least defensible of the items in the charge of neglectbrought against his contemporaries. In some of the others there is agood deal of exaggeration. To listen to most of his biographers onewould suppose that all Spain was in league not only against the man butagainst his memory, or at least that it was insensible to his merits,and left him to live in misery and die of want. To talk of his hardlife and unworthy employments in Andalusia is absurd. What had he doneto distinguish him from thousands of other struggling men earning aprecarious livelihood? True, he was a gallant soldier, who had beenwounded and had undergone captivity and suffering in his country'scause, but there were hundreds of others in the same case. He hadwritten a mediocre specimen of an insipid class of romance, and someplays which manifestly did not comply with the primary condition ofpleasing: were the playgoers to patronise plays that did not amusethem, because the author was to produce "Don Quixote" twenty yearsafterwards?The scramble for copies which, as we have seen, followed immediately onthe appearance of the book, does not look like general insensibility toits merits. No doubt it was received coldly by some, but if a manwrites a book in ridicule of periwigs he must make his account withbeing coldly received by the periwig wearers and hated by the wholetribe of wigmakers. If Cervantes had the chivalry-romance readers, thesentimentalists, the dramatists, and the poets of the period allagainst him, it was because "Don Quixote" was what it was; and if thegeneral public did not come forward to make him comfortable for therest of his days, it is no more to be charged with neglect andingratitude than the English-speaking public that did not pay offScott's liabilities. It did the best it could; it read his book andliked it and bought it, and encouraged the bookseller to pay him wellfor others.It has been also made a reproach to Spain that she has erected nomonument to the man she is proudest of; no monument, that is to say, ofhim; for the bronze statue in the little garden of the Plaza de lasCortes, a fair work of art no doubt, and unexceptionable had it beenset up to the local poet in the market-place of some provincial town,is not worthy of Cervantes or of Madrid. But what need has Cervantes of"such weak witness of his name;" or what could a monument do in hiscase except testify to the self-glorification of those who had put itup? Si monumentum quoeris, circumspice. The nearest bookseller's shopwill show what bathos there would be in a monument to the author of"Don Quixote."'DON QUIXOTE'Nine editions of the First Part of "Don Quixote" had already appearedbefore Cervantes died, thirty thousand copies in all, according to hisown estimate, and a tenth was printed at Barcelona the year after hisdeath. So large a number naturally supplied the demand for some time,but by 1634 it appears to have been exhausted; and from that time downto the present day the stream of editions has continued to flow rapidlyand regularly. The translations show still more clearly in what requestthe book has been from the very outset. In seven years from thecompletion of the work it had been translated into the four leadinglanguages of Europe. Except the Bible, in fact, no book has been sowidely diffused as "Don Quixote." The "Imitatio Christi" may have beentranslated into as many different languages, and perhaps "RobinsonCrusoe" and the "Vicar of Wakefield" into nearly as many, but inmultiplicity of translations and editions "Don Quixote" leaves them allfar behind.Still more remarkable is the character of this wide diffusion. "DonQuixote" has been thoroughly naturalised among people whose ideas aboutknight-errantry, if they had any at all, were of the vaguest, who hadnever seen or heard of a book of chivalry, who could not possibly feelthe humour of the burlesque or sympathise with the author's purpose.Another curious fact is that this, the most cosmopolitan book in theworld, is one of the most intensely national. "Manon Lescaut" is notmore thoroughly French, "Tom Jones" not more English, "Rob Roy" notmore Scotch, than "Don Quixote" is Spanish, in character, in ideas, insentiment, in local colour, in everything. What, then, is the secret ofthis unparalleled popularity, increasing year by year for well-nighthree centuries? One explanation, no doubt, is that of all the books inthe world, "Don Quixote" is the most catholic. There is something in itfor every sort of reader, young or old, sage or simple, high or low. AsCervantes himself says with a touch of pride, "It is thumbed and readand got by heart by people of all sorts; the children turn its leaves,the young people read it, the grown men understand it, the old folkpraise it."But it would be idle to deny that the ingredient which, more than itshumour, or its wisdom, or the fertility of invention or knowledge ofhuman nature it displays, has insured its success with the multitude,is the vein of farce that runs through it. It was the attack upon thesheep, the battle with the wine-skins, Mambrino's helmet, the balsam ofFierabras, Don Quixote knocked over by the sails of the windmill,Sancho tossed in the blanket, the mishaps and misadventures of masterand man, that were originally the great attraction, and perhaps are sostill to some extent with the majority of readers. It is plain that"Don Quixote" was generally regarded at first, and indeed in Spain fora long time, as little more than a queer droll book, full of laughableincidents and absurd situations, very amusing, but not entitled to muchconsideration or care. All the editions printed in Spain from 1637 to1771, when the famous printer Ibarra took it up, were mere tradeeditions, badly and carelessly printed on vile paper and got up in thestyle of chap-books intended only for popular use, with, in mostinstances, uncouth illustrations and clap-trap additions by thepublisher.To England belongs the credit of having been the first country torecognise the right of "Don Quixote" to better treatment than this. TheLondon edition of 1738, commonly called Lord Carteret's from havingbeen suggested by him, was not a mere _edition de luxe_. It produced"Don Quixote" in becoming form as regards paper and type, andembellished with plates which, if not particularly happy asillustrations, were at least well intentioned and well executed, but italso aimed at correctness of text, a matter to which nobody except theeditors of the Valencia and Brussels editions had given even a passingthought; and for a first attempt it was fairly successful, for thoughsome of its emendations are inadmissible, a good many of them have beenadopted by all subsequent editors.The zeal of publishers, editors, and annotators brought about aremarkable change of sentiment with regard to "Don Quixote." A vastnumber of its admirers began to grow ashamed of laughing over it. Itbecame almost a crime to treat it as a humorous book. The humour wasnot entirely denied, but, according to the new view, it was rated as analtogether secondary quality, a mere accessory, nothing more than thestalking-horse under the presentation of which Cervantes shot hisphilosophy or his satire, or whatever it was he meant to shoot; for onthis point opinions varied. All were agreed, however, that the objecthe aimed at was not the books of chivalry. He said emphatically in thepreface to the First Part and in the last sentence of the Second, thathe had no other object in view than to discredit these books, and this,to advanced criticism, made it clear that his object must have beensomething else.One theory was that the book was a kind of allegory, setting forth theeternal struggle between the ideal and the real, between the spirit ofpoetry and the spirit of prose; and perhaps German philosophy neverevolved a more ungainly or unlikely camel out of the depths of itsinner consciousness. Something of the antagonism, no doubt, is to befound in "Don Quixote," because it is to be found everywhere in life,and Cervantes drew from life. It is difficult to imagine a community inwhich the never-ceasing game of cross-purposes between Sancho Panza andDon Quixote would not be recognised as true to nature. In the stoneage, among the lake dwellers, among the cave men, there were DonQuixotes and Sancho Panzas; there must have been the troglodyte whonever could see the facts before his eyes, and the troglodyte who couldsee nothing else. But to suppose Cervantes deliberately setting himselfto expound any such idea in two stout quarto volumes is to supposesomething not only very unlike the age in which he lived, butaltogether unlike Cervantes himself, who would have been the first tolaugh at an attempt of the sort made by anyone else.The extraordinary influence of the romances of chivalry in his day isquite enough to account for the genesis of the book. Some idea of theprodigious development of this branch of literature in the sixteenthcentury may be obtained from the scrutiny of Chapter VII, if the readerbears in mind that only a portion of the romances belonging to by farthe largest group are enumerated. As to its effect upon the nation,there is abundant evidence. From the time when the Amadises andPalmerins began to grow popular down to the very end of the century,there is a steady stream of invective, from men whose character andposition lend weight to their words, against the romances of chivalryand the infatuation of their readers. Ridicule was the only besom tosweep away that dust.That this was the task Cervantes set himself, and that he had ampleprovocation to urge him to it, will be sufficiently clear to those wholook into the evidence; as it will be also that it was not chivalryitself that he attacked and swept away. Of all the absurdities that,thanks to poetry, will be repeated to the end of time, there is nogreater one than saying that "Cervantes smiled Spain's chivalry away."In the first place there was no chivalry for him to smile away. Spain'schivalry had been dead for more than a century. Its work was done whenGranada fell, and as chivalry was essentially republican in its nature,it could not live under the rule that Ferdinand substituted for thefree institutions of mediaeval Spain. What he did smile away was notchivalry but a degrading mockery of it.The true nature of the "right arm" and the "bright array," beforewhich, according to the poet, "the world gave ground," and whichCervantes' single laugh demolished, may be gathered from the words ofone of his own countrymen, Don Felix Pacheco, as reported by CaptainGeorge Carleton, in his "Military Memoirs from 1672 to 1713." "Beforethe appearance in the world of that labour of Cervantes," he said, "itwas next to an impossibility for a man to walk the streets with anydelight or without danger. There were seen so many cavaliers prancingand curvetting before the windows of their mistresses, that a strangerwould have imagined the whole nation to have been nothing less than arace of knight-errants. But after the world became a little acquaintedwith that notable history, the man that was seen in that oncecelebrated drapery was pointed at as a Don Quixote, and found himselfthe jest of high and low. And I verily believe that to this, and thisonly, we owe that dampness and poverty of spirit which has run throughall our councils for a century past, so little agreeable to thosenobler actions of our famous ancestors."To call "Don Quixote" a sad book, preaching a pessimist view of life,argues a total misconception of its drift. It would be so if its moralwere that, in this world, true enthusiasm naturally leads to ridiculeand discomfiture. But it preaches nothing of the sort; its moral, sofar as it can be said to have one, is that the spurious enthusiasm thatis born of vanity and self-conceit, that is made an end in itself, nota means to an end, that acts on mere impulse, regardless ofcircumstances and consequences, is mischievous to its owner, and a veryconsiderable nuisance to the community at large. To those who cannotdistinguish between the one kind and the other, no doubt "Don Quixote"is a sad book; no doubt to some minds it is very sad that a man who hadjust uttered so beautiful a sentiment as that "it is a hard case tomake slaves of those whom God and Nature made free," should beungratefully pelted by the scoundrels his crazy philanthropy had letloose on society; but to others of a more judicial cast it will be amatter of regret that reckless self-sufficient enthusiasm is notoftener requited in some such way for all the mischief it does in theworld.A very slight examination of the structure of "Don Quixote" willsuffice to show that Cervantes had no deep design or elaborate plan inhis mind when he began the book. When he wrote those lines in which"with a few strokes of a great master he sets before us the paupergentleman," he had no idea of the goal to which his imagination wasleading him. There can be little doubt that all he contemplated was ashort tale to range with those he had already written, a tale settingforth the ludicrous results that might be expected to follow theattempt of a crazy gentleman to act the part of a knight-errant inmodern life.It is plain, for one thing, that Sancho Panza did not enter into theoriginal scheme, for had Cervantes thought of him he certainly wouldnot have omitted him in his hero's outfit, which he obviously meant tobe complete. Him we owe to the landlord's chance remark in Chapter IIIthat knights seldom travelled without squires. To try to think of a DonQuixote without Sancho Panza is like trying to think of a one-bladedpair of scissors.The story was written at first, like the others, without any divisionand without the intervention of Cid Hamete Benengeli; and it seems notunlikely that Cervantes had some intention of bringing Dulcinea, orAldonza Lorenzo, on the scene in person. It was probably the ransackingof the Don's library and the discussion on the books of chivalry thatfirst suggested it to him that his idea was capable of development.What, if instead of a mere string of farcical misadventures, he were tomake his tale a burlesque of one of these books, caricaturing theirstyle, incidents, and spirit?In pursuance of this change of plan, he hastily and somewhat clumsilydivided what he had written into chapters on the model of "Amadis,"invented the fable of a mysterious Arabic manuscript, and set up CidHamete Benengeli in imitation of the almost invariable practice of thechivalry-romance authors, who were fond of tracing their books to somerecondite source. In working out the new ideas, he soon found the valueof Sancho Panza. Indeed, the keynote, not only to Sancho's part, but tothe whole book, is struck in the first words Sancho utters when heannounces his intention of taking his ass with him. "About the ass," weare told, "Don Quixote hesitated a little, trying whether he could callto mind any knight-errant taking with him an esquire mounted onass-back; but no instance occurred to his memory." We can see the wholescene at a glance, the stolid unconsciousness of Sancho and theperplexity of his master, upon whose perception the incongruity hasjust forced itself. This is Sancho's mission throughout the book; he isan unconscious Mephistopheles, always unwittingly making mockery of hismaster's aspirations, always exposing the fallacy of his ideas by someunintentional ad absurdum, always bringing him back to the world offact and commonplace by force of sheer stolidity.By the time Cervantes had got his volume of novels off his hands, andsummoned up resolution enough to set about the Second Part in earnest,the case was very much altered. Don Quixote and Sancho Panza had notmerely found favour, but had already become, what they have never sinceceased to be, veritable entities to the popular imagination. There wasno occasion for him now to interpolate extraneous matter; nay, hisreaders told him plainly that what they wanted of him was more DonQuixote and more Sancho Panza, and not novels, tales, or digressions.To himself, too, his creations had become realities, and he had becomeproud of them, especially of Sancho. He began the Second Part,therefore, under very different conditions, and the difference makesitself manifest at once. Even in translation the style will be seen tobe far easier, more flowing, more natural, and more like that of a mansure of himself and of his audience. Don Quixote and Sancho undergo achange also. In the First Part, Don Quixote has no character orindividuality whatever. He is nothing more than a crazy representativeof the sentiments of the chivalry romances. In all that he says anddoes he is simply repeating the lesson he has learned from his books;and therefore, it is absurd to speak of him in the gushing strain ofthe sentimental critics when they dilate upon his nobleness,disinterestedness, dauntless courage, and so forth. It was the businessof a knight-errant to right wrongs, redress injuries, and succour thedistressed, and this, as a matter of course, he makes his business whenhe takes up the part; a knight-errant was bound to be intrepid, and sohe feels bound to cast fear aside. Of all Byron's melodious nonsenseabout Don Quixote, the most nonsensical statement is that "'tis hisvirtue makes him mad!" The exact opposite is the truth; it is hismadness makes him virtuous.In the Second Part, Cervantes repeatedly reminds the reader, as if itwas a point upon which he was anxious there should be no mistake, thathis hero's madness is strictly confined to delusions on the subject ofchivalry, and that on every other subject he is discreto, one, in fact,whose faculty of discernment is in perfect order. The advantage of thisis that he is enabled to make use of Don Quixote as a mouthpiece forhis own reflections, and so, without seeming to digress, allow himselfthe relief of digression when he requires it, as freely as in acommonplace book.It is true the amount of individuality bestowed upon Don Quixote is notvery great. There are some natural touches of character about him, suchas his mixture of irascibility and placability, and his curiousaffection for Sancho together with his impatience of the squire'sloquacity and impertinence; but in the main, apart from his craze, heis little more than a thoughtful, cultured gentleman, with instinctivegood taste and a great deal of shrewdness and originality of mind.As to Sancho, it is plain, from the concluding words of the preface tothe First Part, that he was a favourite with his creator even before hehad been taken into favour by the public. An inferior genius, takinghim in hand a second time, would very likely have tried to improve himby making him more comical, clever, amiable, or virtuous. But Cervanteswas too true an artist to spoil his work in this way. Sancho, when hereappears, is the old Sancho with the old familiar features; but with adifference; they have been brought out more distinctly, but at the sametime with a careful avoidance of anything like caricature; the outlinehas been filled in where filling in was necessary, and, vivified by afew touches of a master's hand, Sancho stands before us as he might ina character portrait by Velazquez. He is a much more important andprominent figure in the Second Part than in the First; indeed, it ishis matchless mendacity about Dulcinea that to a great extent suppliesthe action of the story.His development in this respect is as remarkable as in any other. Inthe First Part he displays a great natural gift of lying. His lies arenot of the highly imaginative sort that liars in fiction commonlyindulge in; like Falstaff's, they resemble the father that begets them;they are simple, homely, plump lies; plain working lies, in short. Butin the service of such a master as Don Quixote he develops rapidly, aswe see when he comes to palm off the three country wenches as Dulcineaand her ladies in waiting. It is worth noticing how, flushed by hissuccess in this instance, he is tempted afterwards to try a flightbeyond his powers in his account of the journey on Clavileno.In the Second Part it is the spirit rather than the incidents of thechivalry romances that is the subject of the burlesque. Enchantments ofthe sort travestied in those of Dulcinea and the Trifaldi and the caveof Montesinos play a leading part in the later and inferior romances,and another distinguishing feature is caricatured in Don Quixote'sblind adoration of Dulcinea. In the romances of chivalry love is eithera mere animalism or a fantastic idolatry. Only a coarse-minded manwould care to make merry with the former, but to one of Cervantes'humour the latter was naturally an attractive subject for ridicule.Like everything else in these romances, it is a gross exaggeration ofthe real sentiment of chivalry, but its peculiar extravagance isprobably due to the influence of those masters of hyperbole, theProvencal poets. When a troubadour professed his readiness to obey hislady in all things, he made it incumbent upon the next comer, if hewished to avoid the imputation of tameness and commonplace, to declarehimself the slave of her will, which the next was compelled to cap bysome still stronger declaration; and so expressions of devotion went onrising one above the other like biddings at an auction, and aconventional language of gallantry and theory of love came into beingthat in time permeated the literature of Southern Europe, and borefruit, in one direction in the transcendental worship of Beatrice andLaura, and in another in the grotesque idolatry which found exponentsin writers like Feliciano de Silva. This is what Cervantes deals within Don Quixote's passion for Dulcinea, and in no instance has hecarried out the burlesque more happily. By keeping Dulcinea in thebackground, and making her a vague shadowy being of whose veryexistence we are left in doubt, he invests Don Quixote's worship of hervirtues and charms with an additional extravagance, and gives stillmore point to the caricature of the sentiment and language of theromances.One of the great merits of "Don Quixote," and one of the qualities thathave secured its acceptance by all classes of readers and made it themost cosmopolitan of books, is its simplicity. There are, of course,points obvious enough to a Spanish seventeenth century audience whichdo not immediately strike a reader now-a-days, and Cervantes oftentakes it for granted that an allusion will be generally understoodwhich is only intelligible to a few. For example, on many of hisreaders in Spain, and most of his readers out of it, the significanceof his choice of a country for his hero is completely lost. It would begoing too far to say that no one can thoroughly comprehend "DonQuixote" without having seen La Mancha, but undoubtedly even a glimpseof La Mancha will give an insight into the meaning of Cervantes such asno commentator can give. Of all the regions of Spain it is the lastthat would suggest the idea of romance. Of all the dull central plateauof the Peninsula it is the dullest tract. There is something impressiveabout the grim solitudes of Estremadura; and if the plains of Leon andOld Castile are bald and dreary, they are studded with old citiesrenowned in history and rich in relics of the past. But there is noredeeming feature in the Manchegan landscape; it has all the samenessof the desert without its dignity; the few towns and villages thatbreak its monotony are mean and commonplace, there is nothing venerableabout them, they have not even the picturesqueness of poverty; indeed,Don Quixote's own village, Argamasilla, has a sort of oppressiverespectability in the prim regularity of its streets and houses;everything is ignoble; the very windmills are the ugliest and shabbiestof the windmill kind.To anyone who knew the country well, the mere style and title of "DonQuixote of La Mancha" gave the key to the author's meaning at once. LaMancha as the knight's country and scene of his chivalries is of apiece with the pasteboard helmet, the farm-labourer on ass-back for asquire, knighthood conferred by a rascally ventero, convicts taken forvictims of oppression, and the rest of the incongruities between DonQuixote's world and the world he lived in, between things as he sawthem and things as they were.It is strange that this element of incongruity, underlying the wholehumour and purpose of the book, should have been so little heeded bythe majority of those who have undertaken to interpret "Don Quixote."It has been completely overlooked, for example, by the illustrators. Tobe sure, the great majority of the artists who illustrated "DonQuixote" knew nothing whatever of Spain. To them a venta conveyed noidea but the abstract one of a roadside inn, and they could nottherefore do full justice to the humour of Don Quixote's misconceptionin taking it for a castle, or perceive the remoteness of all itsrealities from his ideal. But even when better informed they seem tohave no apprehension of the full force of the discrepancy. Take, forinstance, Gustave Dore's drawing of Don Quixote watching his armour inthe inn-yard. Whether or not the Venta de Quesada on the Seville roadis, as tradition maintains, the inn described in "Don Quixote," beyondall question it was just such an inn-yard as the one behind it thatCervantes had in his mind's eye, and it was on just such a rude stonetrough as that beside the primitive draw-well in the corner that hemeant Don Quixote to deposit his armour. Gustave Dore makes it anelaborate fountain such as no arriero ever watered his mules at in thecorral of any venta in Spain, and thereby entirely misses the pointaimed at by Cervantes. It is the mean, prosaic, commonplace characterof all the surroundings and circumstances that gives a significance toDon Quixote's vigil and the ceremony that follows.Cervantes' humour is for the most part of that broader and simplersort, the strength of which lies in the perception of the incongruous.It is the incongruity of Sancho in all his ways, words, and works, withthe ideas and aims of his master, quite as much as the wonderfulvitality and truth to nature of the character, that makes him the mosthumorous creation in the whole range of fiction. That unsmiling gravityof which Cervantes was the first great master, "Cervantes' seriousair," which sits naturally on Swift alone, perhaps, of laterhumourists, is essential to this kind of humour, and here againCervantes has suffered at the hands of his interpreters. Nothing,unless indeed the coarse buffoonery of Phillips, could be more out ofplace in an attempt to represent Cervantes, than a flippant, would-befacetious style, like that of Motteux's version for example, or thesprightly, jaunty air, French translators sometimes adopt. It is thegrave matter-of-factness of the narrative, and the apparentunconsciousness of the author that he is saying anything ludicrous,anything but the merest commonplace, that give its peculiar flavour tothe humour of Cervantes. His, in fact, is the exact opposite of thehumour of Sterne and the self-conscious humourists. Even when UncleToby is at his best, you are always aware of "the man Sterne" behindhim, watching you over his shoulder to see what effect he is producing.Cervantes always leaves you alone with Don Quixote and Sancho. He andSwift and the great humourists always keep themselves out of sight, or,more properly speaking, never think about themselves at all, unlike ourlatter-day school of humourists, who seem to have revived the oldhorse-collar method, and try to raise a laugh by some grotesqueassumption of ignorance, imbecility, or bad taste.It is true that to do full justice to Spanish humour in any otherlanguage is well-nigh an impossibility. There is a natural gravity anda sonorous stateliness about Spanish, be it ever so colloquial, thatmake an absurdity doubly absurd, and give plausibility to the mostpreposterous statement. This is what makes Sancho Panza's drollery thedespair of the conscientious translator. Sancho's curt comments cannever fall flat, but they lose half their flavour when transferred fromtheir native Castilian into any other medium. But if foreigners havefailed to do justice to the humour of Cervantes, they are no worse thanhis own countrymen. Indeed, were it not for the Spanish peasant'srelish of "Don Quixote," one might be tempted to think that the greathumourist was not looked upon as a humourist at all in his own country.The craze of Don Quixote seems, in some instances, to have communicateditself to his critics, making them see things that are not in the bookand run full tilt at phantoms that have no existence save in their ownimaginations. Like a good many critics now-a-days, they forget thatscreams are not criticism, and that it is only vulgar tastes that areinfluenced by strings of superlatives, three-piled hyperboles, andpompous epithets. But what strikes one as particularly strange is thatwhile they deal in extravagant eulogies, and ascribe all manner ofimaginary ideas and qualities to Cervantes, they show no perception ofthe quality that ninety-nine out of a hundred of his readers would ratehighest in him, and hold to be the one that raises him above allrivalry.To speak of "Don Quixote" as if it were merely a humorous book would bea manifest misdescription. Cervantes at times makes it a kind ofcommonplace book for occasional essays and criticisms, or for theobservations and reflections and gathered wisdom of a long and stirringlife. It is a mine of shrewd observation on mankind and human nature.Among modern novels there may be, here and there, more elaboratestudies of character, but there is no book richer in individualisedcharacter. What Coleridge said of Shakespeare in minimis is true ofCervantes; he never, even for the most temporary purpose, puts forwarda lay figure. There is life and individuality in all his characters,however little they may have to do, or however short a time they may bebefore the reader. Samson Carrasco, the curate, Teresa Panza,Altisidora, even the two students met on the road to the cave ofMontesinos, all live and move and have their being; and it ischaracteristic of the broad humanity of Cervantes that there is not ahateful one among them all. Even poor Maritornes, with her deplorablemorals, has a kind heart of her own and "some faint and distantresemblance to a Christian about her;" and as for Sancho, though ondissection we fail to find a lovable trait in him, unless it be a sortof dog-like affection for his master, who is there that in his heartdoes not love him?But it is, after all, the humour of "Don Quixote" that distinguishes itfrom all other books of the romance kind. It is this that makes it, asone of the most judicial-minded of modern critics calls it, "the bestnovel in the world beyond all comparison." It is its varied humour,ranging from broad farce to comedy as subtle as Shakespeare's orMoliere's that has naturalised it in every country where there arereaders, and made it a classic in every language that has a literature.THE AUTHOR'S PREFACEIdle reader: thou mayest believe me without any oath that I would thisbook, as it is the child of my brain, were the fairest, gayest, andcleverest that could be imagined. But I could not counteract Nature'slaw that everything shall beget its like; and what, then, could thissterile, illtilled wit of mine beget but the story of a dry,shrivelled, whimsical offspring, full of thoughts of all sorts and suchas never came into any other imagination--just what might be begotten ina prison, where every misery is lodged and every doleful sound makesits dwelling? Tranquillity, a cheerful retreat, pleasant fields, brightskies, murmuring brooks, peace of mind, these are the things that gofar to make even the most barren muses fertile, and bring into theworld births that fill it with wonder and delight. Sometimes when afather has an ugly, loutish son, the love he bears him so blindfoldshis eyes that he does not see his defects, or, rather, takes them forgifts and charms of mind and body, and talks of them to his friends aswit and grace. I, however--for though I pass for the father, I am butthe stepfather to "Don Quixote"--have no desire to go with the currentof custom, or to implore thee, dearest reader, almost with tears in myeyes, as others do, to pardon or excuse the defects thou wilt perceivein this child of mine. Thou art neither its kinsman nor its friend, thysoul is thine own and thy will as free as any man's, whate'er he be,thou art in thine own house and master of it as much as the king of histaxes and thou knowest the common saying, "Under my cloak I kill theking;" all which exempts and frees thee from every consideration andobligation, and thou canst say what thou wilt of the story without fearof being abused for any ill or rewarded for any good thou mayest say ofit.My wish would be simply to present it to thee plain and unadorned,without any embellishment of preface or uncountable muster of customarysonnets, epigrams, and eulogies, such as are commonly put at thebeginning of books. For I can tell thee, though composing it cost mesome labour, I found none greater than the making of this Preface thouart now reading. Many times did I take up my pen to write it, and manydid I lay it down again, not knowing what to write. One of these times,as I was pondering with the paper before me, a pen in my ear, my elbowon the desk, and my cheek in my hand, thinking of what I should say,there came in unexpectedly a certain lively, clever friend of mine,who, seeing me so deep in thought, asked the reason; to which I, makingno mystery of it, answered that I was thinking of the Preface I had tomake for the story of "Don Quixote," which so troubled me that I had amind not to make any at all, nor even publish the achievements of sonoble a knight."For, how could you expect me not to feel uneasy about what thatancient lawgiver they call the Public will say when it sees me, afterslumbering so many years in the silence of oblivion, coming out nowwith all my years upon my back, and with a book as dry as a rush,devoid of invention, meagre in style, poor in thoughts, wholly wantingin learning and wisdom, without quotations in the margin or annotationsat the end, after the fashion of other books I see, which, though allfables and profanity, are so full of maxims from Aristotle, and Plato,and the whole herd of philosophers, that they fill the readers withamazement and convince them that the authors are men of learning,erudition, and eloquence. And then, when they quote the HolyScriptures!--anyone would say they are St. Thomases or other doctors ofthe Church, observing as they do a decorum so ingenious that in onesentence they describe a distracted lover and in the next deliver adevout little sermon that it is a pleasure and a treat to hear andread. Of all this there will be nothing in my book, for I have nothingto quote in the margin or to note at the end, and still less do I knowwhat authors I follow in it, to place them at the beginning, as all do,under the letters A, B, C, beginning with Aristotle and ending withXenophon, or Zoilus, or Zeuxis, though one was a slanderer and theother a painter. Also my book must do without sonnets at the beginning,at least sonnets whose authors are dukes, marquises, counts, bishops,ladies, or famous poets. Though if I were to ask two or three obligingfriends, I know they would give me them, and such as the productions ofthose that have the highest reputation in our Spain could not equal."In short, my friend," I continued, "I am determined that Senor DonQuixote shall remain buried in the archives of his own La Mancha untilHeaven provide someone to garnish him with all those things he standsin need of; because I find myself, through my shallowness and want oflearning, unequal to supplying them, and because I am by nature shy andcareless about hunting for authors to say what I myself can say withoutthem. Hence the cogitation and abstraction you found me in, and reasonenough, what you have heard from me."Hearing this, my friend, giving himself a slap on the forehead andbreaking into a hearty laugh, exclaimed, "Before God, Brother, now am Idisabused of an error in which I have been living all this long time Ihave known you, all through which I have taken you to be shrewd andsensible in all you do; but now I see you are as far from that as theheaven is from the earth. Is it possible that things of so littlemoment and so easy to set right can occupy and perplex a ripe wit likeyours, fit to break through and crush far greater obstacles? By myfaith, this comes, not of any want of ability, but of too muchindolence and too little knowledge of life. Do you want to know if I amtelling the truth? Well, then, attend to me, and you will see how, inthe opening and shutting of an eye, I sweep away all your difficulties,and supply all those deficiencies which you say check and discourageyou from bringing before the world the story of your famous DonQuixote, the light and mirror of all knight-errantry.""Say on," said I, listening to his talk; "how do you propose to make upfor my diffidence, and reduce to order this chaos of perplexity I amin?"To which he made answer, "Your first difficulty about the sonnets,epigrams, or complimentary verses which you want for the beginning, andwhich ought to be by persons of importance and rank, can be removed ifyou yourself take a little trouble to make them; you can afterwardsbaptise them, and put any name you like to them, fathering them onPrester John of the Indies or the Emperor of Trebizond, who, to myknowledge, were said to have been famous poets: and even if they werenot, and any pedants or bachelors should attack you and question thefact, never care two maravedis for that, for even if they prove a lieagainst you they cannot cut off the hand you wrote it with."As to references in the margin to the books and authors from whom youtake the aphorisms and sayings you put into your story, it is onlycontriving to fit in nicely any sentences or scraps of Latin you mayhappen to have by heart, or at any rate that will not give you muchtrouble to look up; so as, when you speak of freedom and captivity, toinsert_Non bene pro toto libertas venditur auro;_and then refer in the margin to Horace, or whoever said it; or, if youallude to the power of death, to come in with--_Pallida mors aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas,Regumque turres._"If it be friendship and the love God bids us bear to our enemy, go atonce to the Holy Scriptures, which you can do with a very small amountof research, and quote no less than the words of God himself: _Egoautem dico vobis: diligite inimicos vestros._ If you speak of evilthoughts, turn to the Gospel: _De corde exeunt cogitationes malae._ Ifof the fickleness of friends, there is Cato, who will give you hisdistich:_Donec eris felix multos numerabis amicos,Tempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris._"With these and such like bits of Latin they will take you for agrammarian at all events, and that now-a-days is no small honour andprofit."With regard to adding annotations at the end of the book, you maysafely do it in this way. If you mention any giant in your bookcontrive that it shall be the giant Goliath, and with this alone, whichwill cost you almost nothing, you have a grand note, for you canput--_The giant Golias or Goliath was a Philistine whom the shepherdDavid slew by a mighty stone-cast in the Terebinth valley, as isrelated in the Book of Kings_--in the chapter where you find it written."Next, to prove yourself a man of erudition in polite literature andcosmography, manage that the river Tagus shall be named in your story,and there you are at once with another famous annotation, settingforth--_The river Tagus was so called after a King of Spain: it has itssource in such and such a place and falls into the ocean, kissing thewalls of the famous city of Lisbon, and it is a common belief that ithas golden sands_, etc. If you should have anything to do with robbers,I will give you the story of Cacus, for I have it by heart; if withloose women, there is the Bishop of Mondonedo, who will give you theloan of Lamia, Laida, and Flora, any reference to whom will bring yougreat credit; if with hard-hearted ones, Ovid will furnish you withMedea; if with witches or enchantresses, Homer has Calypso, and VirgilCirce; if with valiant captains, Julius Caesar himself will lend youhimself in his own 'Commentaries,' and Plutarch will give you athousand Alexanders. If you should deal with love, with two ounces youmay know of Tuscan you can go to Leon the Hebrew, who will supply youto your heart's content; or if you should not care to go to foreigncountries you have at home Fonseca's 'Of the Love of God,' in which iscondensed all that you or the most imaginative mind can want on thesubject. In short, all you have to do is to manage to quote thesenames, or refer to these stories I have mentioned, and leave it to meto insert the annotations and quotations, and I swear by all that'sgood to fill your margins and use up four sheets at the end of thebook."Now let us come to those references to authors which other books have,and you want for yours. The remedy for this is very simple: You haveonly to look out for some book that quotes them all, from A to Z as yousay yourself, and then insert the very same alphabet in your book, andthough the imposition may be plain to see, because you have so littleneed to borrow from them, that is no matter; there will probably besome simple enough to believe that you have made use of them all inthis plain, artless story of yours. At any rate, if it answers no otherpurpose, this long catalogue of authors will serve to give a surprisinglook of authority to your book. Besides, no one will trouble himself toverify whether you have followed them or whether you have not, being noway concerned in it; especially as, if I mistake not, this book ofyours has no need of any one of those things you say it wants, for itis, from beginning to end, an attack upon the books of chivalry, ofwhich Aristotle never dreamt, nor St. Basil said a word, nor Cicero hadany knowledge; nor do the niceties of truth nor the observations ofastrology come within the range of its fanciful vagaries; nor havegeometrical measurements or refutations of the arguments used inrhetoric anything to do with it; nor does it mean to preach to anybody,mixing up things human and divine, a sort of motley in which noChristian understanding should dress itself. It has only to availitself of truth to nature in its composition, and the more perfect theimitation the better the work will be. And as this piece of yours aimsat nothing more than to destroy the authority and influence which booksof chivalry have in the world and with the public, there is no need foryou to go a-begging for aphorisms from philosophers, precepts from HolyScripture, fables from poets, speeches from orators, or miracles fromsaints; but merely to take care that your style and diction runmusically, pleasantly, and plainly, with clear, proper, and well-placedwords, setting forth your purpose to the best of your power, andputting your ideas intelligibly, without confusion or obscurity.Strive, too, that in reading your story the melancholy may be moved tolaughter, and the merry made merrier still; that the simple shall notbe wearied, that the judicious shall admire the invention, that thegrave shall not despise it, nor the wise fail to praise it. Finally,keep your aim fixed on the destruction of that ill-founded edifice ofthe books of chivalry, hated by some and praised by many more; for ifyou succeed in this you will have achieved no small success."In profound silence I listened to what my friend said, and hisobservations made such an impression on me that, without attempting toquestion them, I admitted their soundness, and out of them I determinedto make this Preface; wherein, gentle reader, thou wilt perceive myfriend's good sense, my good fortune in finding such an adviser in sucha time of need, and what thou hast gained in receiving, withoutaddition or alteration, the story of the famous Don Quixote of LaMancha, who is held by all the inhabitants of the district of the Campode Montiel to have been the chastest lover and the bravest knight thathas for many years been seen in that neighbourhood. I have no desire tomagnify the service I render thee in making thee acquainted with sorenowned and honoured a knight, but I do desire thy thanks for theacquaintance thou wilt make with the famous Sancho Panza, his squire,in whom, to my thinking, I have given thee condensed all the squirelydrolleries that are scattered through the swarm of the vain books ofchivalry. And so--may God give thee health, and not forget me. Vale.SOME COMMENDATORY VERSESURGANDA THE UNKNOWNTo the book of Don Quixote of la ManchaIf to be welcomed by the good,    O Book! thou make thy steady aim,No empty chatterer will dare    To question or dispute thy claim.But if perchance thou hast a mind    To win of idiots approbation,Lost labour will be thy reward,    Though they'll pretend appreciation.They say a goodly shade he finds    Who shelters 'neath a goodly tree;And such a one thy kindly star    In Bejar bath provided thee:A royal tree whose spreading boughs    A show of princely fruit display;A tree that bears a noble Duke,    The Alexander of his day.Of a Manchegan gentleman    Thy purpose is to tell the story,Relating how he lost his wits    O'er idle tales of love and glory,Of "ladies, arms, and cavaliers:"    A new Orlando Furioso--Innamorato, rather--who    Won Dulcinea del Toboso.Put no vain emblems on thy shield;    All figures--that is bragging play.A modest dedication make,    And give no scoffer room to say,"What! Alvaro de Luna here?    Or is it Hannibal again?Or does King Francis at Madrid    Once more of destiny complain?"Since Heaven it hath not pleased on thee    Deep erudition to bestow,Or black Latino's gift of tongues,    No Latin let thy pages show.Ape not philosophy or wit,    Lest one who cannot comprehend,Make a wry face at thee and ask,    "Why offer flowers to me, my friend?"Be not a meddler; no affair    Of thine the life thy neighbours lead:Be prudent; oft the random jest    Recoils upon the jester's head.Thy constant labour let it be    To earn thyself an honest name,For fooleries preserved in print    Are perpetuity of shame.A further counsel bear in mind:    If that thy roof be made of glass,It shows small wit to pick up stones    To pelt the people as they pass.Win the attention of the wise,    And give the thinker food for thought;Whoso indites frivolities,    Will but by simpletons be sought.AMADIS OF GAULTo Don Quixote of la ManchaSONNETThou that didst imitate that life of mine    When I in lonely sadness on the great    Rock Pena Pobre sat disconsolate,In self-imposed penance there to pine;Thou, whose sole beverage was the bitter brine    Of thine own tears, and who withouten plate    Of silver, copper, tin, in lowly stateOff the bare earth and on earth's fruits didst dine;Live thou, of thine eternal glory sure.    So long as on the round of the fourth sphere    The bright Apollo shall his coursers steer,In thy renown thou shalt remain secure,Thy country's name in story shall endure,    And thy sage author stand without a peer.DON BELIANIS OF GREECETo Don Quixote of la ManchaSONNETIn slashing, hewing, cleaving, word and deed,    I was the foremost knight of chivalry,    Stout, bold, expert, as e'er the world did see;Thousands from the oppressor's wrong I freed;Great were my feats, eternal fame their meed;    In love I proved my truth and loyalty;    The hugest giant was a dwarf for me;Ever to knighthood's laws gave I good heed.My mastery the Fickle Goddess owned,    And even Chance, submitting to control,        Grasped by the forelock, yielded to my will.Yet--though above yon horned moon enthroned        My fortune seems to sit--great Quixote, still    Envy of thy achievements fills my soul.THE LADY OF ORIANATo Dulcinea del TobosoSONNETOh, fairest Dulcinea, could it be!    It were a pleasant fancy to suppose so--    Could Miraflores change to El Toboso,And London's town to that which shelters thee!Oh, could mine but acquire that livery    Of countless charms thy mind and body show so!    Or him, now famous grown--thou mad'st him grow so--Thy knight, in some dread combat could I see!Oh, could I be released from Amadis    By exercise of such coy chastityAs led thee gentle Quixote to dismiss!        Then would my heavy sorrow turn to joy;    None would I envy, all would envy me,        And happiness be mine without alloy.GANDALIN, SQUIRE OF AMADIS OF GAUL,To Sancho Panza, squire of Don QuixoteSONNETAll hail, illustrious man! Fortune, when she    Bound thee apprentice to the esquire trade,    Her care and tenderness of thee displayed,Shaping thy course from misadventure free.No longer now doth proud knight-errantry    Regard with scorn the sickle and the spade;    Of towering arrogance less count is madeThan of plain esquire-like simplicity.I envy thee thy Dapple, and thy name,    And those alforjas thou wast wont to stuffWith comforts that thy providence proclaim.        Excellent Sancho! hail to thee again!        To thee alone the Ovid of our Spain    Does homage with the rustic kiss and cuff.FROM EL DONOSO, THE MOTLEY POET,On Sancho Panza and RocinanteON SANCHOI am the esquire Sancho Pan--Who served Don Quixote of La Man--;But from his service I retreat--,Resolved to pass my life discreet--;For Villadiego, called the Si--,Maintained that only in reti--Was found the secret of well-be--,According to the "Celesti--:"A book divine, except for sin--By speech too plain, in my opin--ON ROCINANTEI am that Rocinante fa--,Great-grandson of great Babie--,Who, all for being lean and bon--,Had one Don Quixote for an own--;But if I matched him well in weak--,I never took short commons meek--,But kept myself in corn by steal--,A trick I learned from Lazaril--,When with a piece of straw so neat--The blind man of his wine he cheat--.ORLANDO FURIOSOTo Don Quixote of La ManchaSONNETIf thou art not a Peer, peer thou hast none;    Among a thousand Peers thou art a peer;    Nor is there room for one when thou art near,Unvanquished victor, great unconquered one!Orlando, by Angelica undone,    Am I; o'er distant seas condemned to steer,    And to Fame's altars as an offering bearValour respected by Oblivion.I cannot be thy rival, for thy fame    And prowess rise above all rivalry,        Albeit both bereft of wits we go.But, though the Scythian or the Moor to tame    Was not thy lot, still thou dost rival me:        Love binds us in a fellowship of woe.THE KNIGHT OF PHOEBUSTo Don Quixote of La ManchaMy sword was not to be compared with thine    Phoebus of Spain, marvel of courtesy,Nor with thy famous arm this hand of mine    That smote from east to west as lightnings fly.    I scorned all empire, and that monarchyThe rosy east held out did I resign    For one glance of Claridiana's eye,The bright Aurora for whose love I pine.A miracle of constancy my love;    And banished by her ruthless cruelty,        This arm had might the rage of Hell to tame.But, Gothic Quixote, happier thou dost prove,        For thou dost live in Dulcinea's name,    And famous, honoured, wise, she lives in thee.FROM SOLISDANTo Don Quixote of La ManchaSONNETYour fantasies, Sir Quixote, it is true,    That crazy brain of yours have quite upset,    But aught of base or mean hath never yetBeen charged by any in reproach to you.Your deeds are open proof in all men's view;    For you went forth injustice to abate,    And for your pains sore drubbings did you getFrom many a rascally and ruffian crew.If the fair Dulcinea, your heart's queen,    Be unrelenting in her cruelty,        If still your woe be powerless to move her,    In such hard case your comfort let it beThat Sancho was a sorry go-between:        A booby he, hard-hearted she, and you no lover.DIALOGUEBetween Babieca and RocinanteSONNET_B_.

It is my earnest hopethat Your Excellency's good counsel in regard to my honourable purpose,will not disdain the littleness of so humble a service.Miguel de Cervantese00.jpg (24K)CHAPTER I.WHICH TREATS OF THE CHARACTER AND PURSUITS OF THE FAMOUS GENTLEMAN DONQUIXOTE OF LA MANCHAp007.jpg (150K)Full SizeIn a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to callto mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep alance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhoundfor coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on mostnights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or soextra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The restof it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes tomatch for holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in hisbest homespun. He had in his house a housekeeper past forty, a nieceunder twenty, and a lad for the field and market-place, who used tosaddle the hack as well as handle the bill-hook. The age of thisgentleman of ours was bordering on fifty; he was of a hardy habit,spare, gaunt-featured, a very early riser and a great sportsman. Theywill have it his surname was Quixada or Quesada (for here there is somedifference of opinion among the authors who write on the subject),although from reasonable conjectures it seems plain that he was calledQuexana. This, however, is of but little importance to our tale; itwill be enough not to stray a hair's breadth from the truth in thetelling of it.You must know, then, that the above-named gentleman whenever he was atleisure (which was mostly all the year round) gave himself up toreading books of chivalry with such ardour and avidity that he almostentirely neglected the pursuit of his field-sports, and even themanagement of his property; and to such a pitch did his eagerness andinfatuation go that he sold many an acre of tillageland to buy books ofchivalry to read, and brought home as many of them as he could get. Butof all there were none he liked so well as those of the famousFeliciano de Silva's composition, for their lucidity of style andcomplicated conceits were as pearls in his sight, particularly when inhis reading he came upon courtships and cartels, where he often foundpassages like "_the reason of the unreason with which my reason isafflicted so weakens my reason that with reason I murmur at yourbeauty;" or again, "the high heavens, that of your divinity divinelyfortify you with the stars, render you deserving of the desert yourgreatness deserves_." Over conceits of this sort the poor gentlemanlost his wits, and used to lie awake striving to understand them andworm the meaning out of them; what Aristotle himself could not havemade out or extracted had he come to life again for that specialpurpose. He was not at all easy about the wounds which Don Belianisgave and took, because it seemed to him that, great as were thesurgeons who had cured him, he must have had his face and body coveredall over with seams and scars. He commended, however, the author's wayof ending his book with the promise of that interminable adventure, andmany a time was he tempted to take up his pen and finish it properly asis there proposed, which no doubt he would have done, and made asuccessful piece of work of it too, had not greater and more absorbingthoughts prevented him.Many an argument did he have with the curate of his village (a learnedman, and a graduate of Siguenza) as to which had been the betterknight, Palmerin of England or Amadis of Gaul. Master Nicholas, thevillage barber, however, used to say that neither of them came up tothe Knight of Phoebus, and that if there was any that could compare with_him_ it was Don Galaor, the brother of Amadis of Gaul, because he hada spirit that was equal to every occasion, and was no finikin knight,nor lachrymose like his brother, while in the matter of valour he wasnot a whit behind him. In short, he became so absorbed in his booksthat he spent his nights from sunset to sunrise, and his days from dawnto dark, poring over them; and what with little sleep and much readinghis brains got so dry that he lost his wits. His fancy grew full ofwhat he used to read about in his books, enchantments, quarrels,battles, challenges, wounds, wooings, loves, agonies, and all sorts ofimpossible nonsense; and it so possessed his mind that the whole fabricof invention and fancy he read of was true, that to him no history inthe world had more reality in it. He used to say the Cid Ruy Diaz was avery good knight, but that he was not to be compared with the Knight ofthe Burning Sword who with one back-stroke cut in half two fierce andmonstrous giants. He thought more of Bernardo del Carpio because atRoncesvalles he slew Roland in spite of enchantments, availing himselfof the artifice of Hercules when he strangled Antaeus the son of Terrain his arms. He approved highly of the giant Morgante, because,although of the giant breed which is always arrogant andill-conditioned, he alone was affable and well-bred. But above all headmired Reinaldos of Montalban, especially when he saw him sallyingforth from his castle and robbing everyone he met, and when beyond theseas he stole that image of Mahomet which, as his history says, wasentirely of gold. To have a bout of kicking at that traitor of aGanelon he would have given his housekeeper, and his niece into thebargain.In short, his wits being quite gone, he hit upon the strangest notionthat ever madman in this world hit upon, and that was that he fanciedit was right and requisite, as well for the support of his own honouras for the service of his country, that he should make a knight-errantof himself, roaming the world over in full armour and on horseback inquest of adventures, and putting in practice himself all that he hadread of as being the usual practices of knights-errant; righting everykind of wrong, and exposing himself to peril and danger from which, inthe issue, he was to reap eternal renown and fame. Already the poor mansaw himself crowned by the might of his arm Emperor of Trebizond atleast; and so, led away by the intense enjoyment he found in thesepleasant fancies, he set himself forthwith to put his scheme intoexecution.The first thing he did was to clean up some armour that had belonged tohis great-grandfather, and had been for ages lying forgotten in acorner eaten with rust and covered with mildew. He scoured and polishedit as best he could, but he perceived one great defect in it, that ithad no closed helmet, nothing but a simple morion. This deficiency,however, his ingenuity supplied, for he contrived a kind of half-helmetof pasteboard which, fitted on to the morion, looked like a whole one.It is true that, in order to see if it was strong and fit to stand acut, he drew his sword and gave it a couple of slashes, the first ofwhich undid in an instant what had taken him a week to do. The easewith which he had knocked it to pieces disconcerted him somewhat, andto guard against that danger he set to work again, fixing bars of ironon the inside until he was satisfied with its strength; and then, notcaring to try any more experiments with it, he passed it and adopted itas a helmet of the most perfect construction.He next proceeded to inspect his hack, which, with more quartos than areal and more blemishes than the steed of Gonela, that "_tantum pelliset ossa fuit_," surpassed in his eyes the Bucephalus of Alexander orthe Babieca of the Cid. Four days were spent in thinking what name togive him, because (as he said to himself) it was not right that a horsebelonging to a knight so famous, and one with such merits of his own,should be without some distinctive name, and he strove to adapt it soas to indicate what he had been before belonging to a knight-errant,and what he then was; for it was only reasonable that, his mastertaking a new character, he should take a new name, and that it shouldbe a distinguished and full-sounding one, befitting the new order andcalling he was about to follow. And so, after having composed, struckout, rejected, added to, unmade, and remade a multitude of names out ofhis memory and fancy, he decided upon calling him Rocinante, a name, tohis thinking, lofty, sonorous, and significant of his condition as ahack before he became what he now was, the first and foremost of allthe hacks in the world.Having got a name for his horse so much to his taste, he was anxious toget one for himself, and he was eight days more pondering over thispoint, till at last he made up his mind to call himself "Don Quixote,"whence, as has been already said, the authors of this veracious historyhave inferred that his name must have been beyond a doubt Quixada, andnot Quesada as others would have it. Recollecting, however, that thevaliant Amadis was not content to call himself curtly Amadis andnothing more, but added the name of his kingdom and country to make itfamous, and called himself Amadis of Gaul, he, like a good knight,resolved to add on the name of his, and to style himself Don Quixote ofLa Mancha, whereby, he considered, he described accurately his originand country, and did honour to it in taking his surname from it.So then, his armour being furbished, his morion turned into a helmet,his hack christened, and he himself confirmed, he came to theconclusion that nothing more was needed now but to look out for a ladyto be in love with; for a knight-errant without love was like a treewithout leaves or fruit, or a body without a soul. As he said tohimself, "If, for my sins, or by my good fortune, I come across somegiant hereabouts, a common occurrence with knights-errant, andoverthrow him in one onslaught, or cleave him asunder to the waist, or,in short, vanquish and subdue him, will it not be well to have someoneI may send him to as a present, that he may come in and fall on hisknees before my sweet lady, and in a humble, submissive voice say, 'Iam the giant Caraculiambro, lord of the island of Malindrania,vanquished in single combat by the never sufficiently extolled knightDon Quixote of La Mancha, who has commanded me to present myself beforeyour Grace, that your Highness dispose of me at your pleasure'?" Oh,how our good gentleman enjoyed the delivery of this speech, especiallywhen he had thought of someone to call his Lady! There was, so thestory goes, in a village near his own a very good-looking farm-girlwith whom he had been at one time in love, though, so far as is known,she never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter. Her name wasAldonza Lorenzo, and upon her he thought fit to confer the title ofLady of his Thoughts; and after some search for a name which should notbe out of harmony with her own, and should suggest and indicate that ofa princess and great lady, he decided upon calling her Dulcinea delToboso--she being of El Toboso--a name, to his mind, musical, uncommon,and significant, like all those he had already bestowed upon himselfand the things belonging to him.p007b.jpg (61K)CHAPTER II.WHICH TREATS OF THE FIRST SALLY THE INGENIOUS DON QUIXOTE MADE FROMHOMEp007c.jpg (97K)Full SizeThese preliminaries settled, he did not care to put off any longer theexecution of his design, urged on to it by the thought of all the worldwas losing by his delay, seeing what wrongs he intended to right,grievances to redress, injustices to repair, abuses to remove, andduties to discharge. So, without giving notice of his intention toanyone, and without anybody seeing him, one morning before the dawningof the day (which was one of the hottest of the month of July) hedonned his suit of armour, mounted Rocinante with his patched-up helmeton, braced his buckler, took his lance, and by the back door of theyard sallied forth upon the plain in the highest contentment andsatisfaction at seeing with what ease he had made a beginning with hisgrand purpose. But scarcely did he find himself upon the open plain,when a terrible thought struck him, one all but enough to make himabandon the enterprise at the very outset. It occurred to him that hehad not been dubbed a knight, and that according to the law of chivalryhe neither could nor ought to bear arms against any knight; and thateven if he had been, still he ought, as a novice knight, to wear whitearmour, without a device upon the shield until by his prowess he hadearned one. These reflections made him waver in his purpose, but hiscraze being stronger than any reasoning, he made up his mind to havehimself dubbed a knight by the first one he came across, following theexample of others in the same case, as he had read in the books thatbrought him to this pass. As for white armour, he resolved, on thefirst opportunity, to scour his until it was whiter than an ermine; andso comforting himself he pursued his way, taking that which his horsechose, for in this he believed lay the essence of adventures.Thus setting out, our new-fledged adventurer paced along, talking tohimself and saying, "Who knows but that in time to come, when theveracious history of my famous deeds is made known, the sage who writesit, when he has to set forth my first sally in the early morning, willdo it after this fashion? 'Scarce had the rubicund Apollo spread o'erthe face of the broad spacious earth the golden threads of his brighthair, scarce had the little birds of painted plumage attuned theirnotes to hail with dulcet and mellifluous harmony the coming of therosy Dawn, that, deserting the soft couch of her jealous spouse, wasappearing to mortals at the gates and balconies of the Mancheganhorizon, when the renowned knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, quittingthe lazy down, mounted his celebrated steed Rocinante and began totraverse the ancient and famous Campo de Montiel;'" which in fact hewas actually traversing. "Happy the age, happy the time," he continued,"in which shall be made known my deeds of fame, worthy to be moulded inbrass, carved in marble, limned in pictures, for a memorial for ever.And thou, O sage magician, whoever thou art, to whom it shall fall tobe the chronicler of this wondrous history, forget not, I entreat thee,my good Rocinante, the constant companion of my ways and wanderings."Presently he broke out again, as if he were love-stricken in earnest,"O Princess Dulcinea, lady of this captive heart, a grievous wrong hastthou done me to drive me forth with scorn, and with inexorable obduracybanish me from the presence of thy beauty. O lady, deign to hold inremembrance this heart, thy vassal, that thus in anguish pines for loveof thee."So he went on stringing together these and other absurdities, all inthe style of those his books had taught him, imitating their languageas well as he could; and all the while he rode so slowly and the sunmounted so rapidly and with such fervour that it was enough to melt hisbrains if he had any. Nearly all day he travelled without anythingremarkable happening to him, at which he was in despair, for he wasanxious to encounter someone at once upon whom to try the might of hisstrong arm.p008.jpg (289K)Full SizeWriters there are who say the first adventure he met with was that ofPuerto Lapice; others say it was that of the windmills; but what I haveascertained on this point, and what I have found written in the annalsof La Mancha, is that he was on the road all day, and towards nightfallhis hack and he found themselves dead tired and hungry, when, lookingall around to see if he could discover any castle or shepherd's shantywhere he might refresh himself and relieve his sore wants, he perceivednot far out of his road an inn, which was as welcome as a star guidinghim to the portals, if not the palaces, of his redemption; andquickening his pace he reached it just as night was setting in. At thedoor were standing two young women, girls of the district as they callthem, on their way to Seville with some carriers who had chanced tohalt that night at the inn; and as, happen what might to ouradventurer, everything he saw or imagined seemed to him to be and tohappen after the fashion of what he read of, the moment he saw the innhe pictured it to himself as a castle with its four turrets andpinnacles of shining silver, not forgetting the drawbridge and moat andall the belongings usually ascribed to castles of the sort. To thisinn, which to him seemed a castle, he advanced, and at a short distancefrom it he checked Rocinante, hoping that some dwarf would show himselfupon the battlements, and by sound of trumpet give notice that a knightwas approaching the castle. But seeing that they were slow about it,and that Rocinante was in a hurry to reach the stable, he made for theinn door, and perceived the two gay damsels who were standing there,and who seemed to him to be two fair maidens or lovely ladies takingtheir ease at the castle gate.At this moment it so happened that a swineherd who was going throughthe stubbles collecting a drove of pigs (for, without any apology, thatis what they are called) gave a blast of his horn to bring themtogether, and forthwith it seemed to Don Quixote to be what he wasexpecting, the signal of some dwarf announcing his arrival; and so withprodigious satisfaction he rode up to the inn and to the ladies, who,seeing a man of this sort approaching in full armour and with lance andbuckler, were turning in dismay into the inn, when Don Quixote,guessing their fear by their flight, raising his pasteboard visor,disclosed his dry dusty visage, and with courteous bearing and gentlevoice addressed them, "Your ladyships need not fly or fear anyrudeness, for that it belongs not to the order of knighthood which Iprofess to offer to anyone, much less to highborn maidens as yourappearance proclaims you to be." The girls were looking at him andstraining their eyes to make out the features which the clumsy visorobscured, but when they heard themselves called maidens, a thing somuch out of their line, they could not restrain their laughter, whichmade Don Quixote wax indignant, and say, "Modesty becomes the fair, andmoreover laughter that has little cause is great silliness; this,however, I say not to pain or anger you, for my desire is none otherthan to serve you."The incomprehensible language and the unpromising looks of our cavalieronly increased the ladies' laughter, and that increased his irritation,and matters might have gone farther if at that moment the landlord hadnot come out, who, being a very fat man, was a very peaceful one. He,seeing this grotesque figure clad in armour that did not match any morethan his saddle, bridle, lance, buckler, or corselet, was not at allindisposed to join the damsels in their manifestations of amusement;but, in truth, standing in awe of such a complicated armament, hethought it best to speak him fairly, so he said, "Senor Caballero, ifyour worship wants lodging, bating the bed (for there is not one in theinn) there is plenty of everything else here." Don Quixote, observingthe respectful bearing of the Alcaide of the fortress (for so innkeeperand inn seemed in his eyes), made answer, "Sir Castellan, for meanything will suffice, for'My armour is my only wear,My only rest the fray.'"The host fancied he called him Castellan because he took him for a"worthy of Castile," though he was in fact an Andalusian, and one fromthe strand of San Lucar, as crafty a thief as Cacus and as full oftricks as a student or a page. "In that case," said he,"'Your bed is on the flinty rock,Your sleep to watch alway;'and if so, you may dismount and safely reckon upon any quantity ofsleeplessness under this roof for a twelvemonth, not to say for asingle night." So saying, he advanced to hold the stirrup for DonQuixote, who got down with great difficulty and exertion (for he hadnot broken his fast all day), and then charged the host to take greatcare of his horse, as he was the best bit of flesh that ever ate breadin this world. The landlord eyed him over but did not find him as goodas Don Quixote said, nor even half as good; and putting him up in thestable, he returned to see what might be wanted by his guest, whom thedamsels, who had by this time made their peace with him, were nowrelieving of his armour. They had taken off his breastplate andbackpiece, but they neither knew nor saw how to open his gorget orremove his make-shift helmet, for he had fastened it with greenribbons, which, as there was no untying the knots, required to be cut.This, however, he would not by any means consent to, so he remained allthe evening with his helmet on, the drollest and oddest figure that canbe imagined; and while they were removing his armour, taking thebaggages who were about it for ladies of high degree belonging to thecastle, he said to them with great sprightliness:"Oh, never, surely, was there knightSo served by hand of dame,As served was he, Don Quixote hight,When from his town he came;With maidens waiting on himself,Princesses on his hack----or Rocinante, for that, ladies mine, is my horse's name, and DonQuixote of La Mancha is my own; for though I had no intention ofdeclaring myself until my achievements in your service and honour hadmade me known, the necessity of adapting that old ballad of Lancelot tothe present occasion has given you the knowledge of my name altogetherprematurely. A time, however, will come for your ladyships to commandand me to obey, and then the might of my arm will show my desire toserve you."The girls, who were not used to hearing rhetoric of this sort, hadnothing to say in reply; they only asked him if he wanted anything toeat. "I would gladly eat a bit of something," said Don Quixote, "for Ifeel it would come very seasonably." The day happened to be a Friday,and in the whole inn there was nothing but some pieces of the fish theycall in Castile "abadejo," in Andalusia "bacallao," and in some places"curadillo," and in others "troutlet;" so they asked him if he thoughthe could eat troutlet, for there was no other fish to give him. "Ifthere be troutlets enough," said Don Quixote, "they will be the samething as a trout; for it is all one to me whether I am given eightreals in small change or a piece of eight; moreover, it may be thatthese troutlets are like veal, which is better than beef, or kid, whichis better than goat. But whatever it be let it come quickly, for theburden and pressure of arms cannot be borne without support to theinside." They laid a table for him at the door of the inn for the sakeof the air, and the host brought him a portion of ill-soaked and worsecooked stockfish, and a piece of bread as black and mouldy as his ownarmour; but a laughable sight it was to see him eating, for having hishelmet on and the beaver up, he could not with his own hands putanything into his mouth unless someone else placed it there, and thisservice one of the ladies rendered him. But to give him anything todrink was impossible, or would have been so had not the landlord boreda reed, and putting one end in his mouth poured the wine into himthrough the other; all which he bore with patience rather than severthe ribbons of his helmet.While this was going on there came up to the inn a sowgelder, who, ashe approached, sounded his reed pipe four or five times, and therebycompletely convinced Don Quixote that he was in some famous castle, andthat they were regaling him with music, and that the stockfish wastrout, the bread the whitest, the wenches ladies, and the landlord thecastellan of the castle; and consequently he held that his enterpriseand sally had been to some purpose. But still it distressed him tothink he had not been dubbed a knight, for it was plain to him he couldnot lawfully engage in any adventure without receiving the order ofknighthood.e02.jpg (39K)CHAPTER III.WHEREIN IS RELATED THE DROLL WAY IN WHICH DON QUIXOTE HAD HIMSELFDUBBED A KNIGHTp009.jpg (164K)Full SizeHarassed by this reflection, he made haste with his scanty pothousesupper, and having finished it called the landlord, and shuttinghimself into the stable with him, fell on his knees before him, saying,"From this spot I rise not, valiant knight, until your courtesy grantsme the boon I seek, one that will redound to your praise and thebenefit of the human race." The landlord, seeing his guest at his feetand hearing a speech of this kind, stood staring at him inbewilderment, not knowing what to do or say, and entreating him torise, but all to no purpose until he had agreed to grant the boondemanded of him. "I looked for no less, my lord, from your HighMagnificence," replied Don Quixote, "and I have to tell you that theboon I have asked and your liberality has granted is that you shall dubme knight to-morrow morning, and that to-night I shall watch my arms inthe chapel of this your castle; thus to-morrow, as I have said, will beaccomplished what I so much desire, enabling me lawfully to roamthrough all the four quarters of the world seeking adventures on behalfof those in distress, as is the duty of chivalry and of knights-errantlike myself, whose ambition is directed to such deeds."The landlord, who, as has been mentioned, was something of a wag, andhad already some suspicion of his guest's want of wits, was quiteconvinced of it on hearing talk of this kind from him, and to makesport for the night he determined to fall in with his humour. So hetold him he was quite right in pursuing the object he had in view, andthat such a motive was natural and becoming in cavaliers asdistinguished as he seemed and his gallant bearing showed him to be;and that he himself in his younger days had followed the samehonourable calling, roaming in quest of adventures in various parts ofthe world, among others the Curing-grounds of Malaga, the Isles ofRiaran, the Precinct of Seville, the Little Market of Segovia, theOlivera of Valencia, the Rondilla of Granada, the Strand of San Lucar,the Colt of Cordova, the Taverns of Toledo, and divers other quarters,where he had proved the nimbleness of his feet and the lightness of hisfingers, doing many wrongs, cheating many widows, ruining maids andswindling minors, and, in short, bringing himself under the notice ofalmost every tribunal and court of justice in Spain; until at last hehad retired to this castle of his, where he was living upon hisproperty and upon that of others; and where he received allknights-errant of whatever rank or condition they might be, all for thegreat love he bore them and that they might share their substance withhim in return for his benevolence. He told him, moreover, that in thiscastle of his there was no chapel in which he could watch his armour,as it had been pulled down in order to be rebuilt, but that in a caseof necessity it might, he knew, be watched anywhere, and he might watchit that night in a courtyard of the castle, and in the morning, Godwilling, the requisite ceremonies might be performed so as to have himdubbed a knight, and so thoroughly dubbed that nobody could be more so.He asked if he had any money with him, to which Don Quixote repliedthat he had not a farthing, as in the histories of knights-errant hehad never read of any of them carrying any. On this point the landlordtold him he was mistaken; for, though not recorded in the histories,because in the author's opinion there was no need to mention anythingso obvious and necessary as money and clean shirts, it was not to besupposed therefore that they did not carry them, and he might regard itas certain and established that all knights-errant (about whom therewere so many full and unimpeachable books) carried well-furnishedpurses in case of emergency, and likewise carried shirts and a littlebox of ointment to cure the wounds they received. For in those plainsand deserts where they engaged in combat and came out wounded, it wasnot always that there was someone to cure them, unless indeed they hadfor a friend some sage magician to succour them at once by fetchingthrough the air upon a cloud some damsel or dwarf with a vial of waterof such virtue that by tasting one drop of it they were cured of theirhurts and wounds in an instant and left as sound as if they had notreceived any damage whatever. But in case this should not occur, theknights of old took care to see that their squires were provided withmoney and other requisites, such as lint and ointments for healingpurposes; and when it happened that knights had no squires (which wasrarely and seldom the case) they themselves carried everything incunning saddle-bags that were hardly seen on the horse's croup, as ifit were something else of more importance, because, unless for somesuch reason, carrying saddle-bags was not very favourably regardedamong knights-errant. He therefore advised him (and, as his godson sosoon to be, he might even command him) never from that time forth totravel without money and the usual requirements, and he would find theadvantage of them when he least expected it.Don Quixote promised to follow his advice scrupulously, and it wasarranged forthwith that he should watch his armour in a large yard atone side of the inn; so, collecting it all together, Don Quixote placedit on a trough that stood by the side of a well, and bracing hisbuckler on his arm he grasped his lance and began with a stately air tomarch up and down in front of the trough, and as he began his marchnight began to fall.The landlord told all the people who were in the inn about the craze ofhis guest, the watching of the armour, and the dubbing ceremony hecontemplated. Full of wonder at so strange a form of madness, theyflocked to see it from a distance, and observed with what composure hesometimes paced up and down, or sometimes, leaning on his lance, gazedon his armour without taking his eyes off it for ever so long; and asthe night closed in with a light from the moon so brilliant that itmight vie with his that lent it, everything the novice knight did wasplainly seen by all.Meanwhile one of the carriers who were in the inn thought fit to waterhis team, and it was necessary to remove Don Quixote's armour as it layon the trough; but he seeing the other approach hailed him in a loudvoice, "O thou, whoever thou art, rash knight that comest to lay handson the armour of the most valorous errant that ever girt on sword, havea care what thou dost; touch it not unless thou wouldst lay down thylife as the penalty of thy rashness." The carrier gave no heed to thesewords (and he would have done better to heed them if he had beenheedful of his health), but seizing it by the straps flung the armoursome distance from him. Seeing this, Don Quixote raised his eyes toheaven, and fixing his thoughts, apparently, upon his lady Dulcinea,exclaimed, "Aid me, lady mine, in this the first encounter thatpresents itself to this breast which thou holdest in subjection; letnot thy favour and protection fail me in this first jeopardy;" and,with these words and others to the same purpose, dropping his bucklerhe lifted his lance with both hands and with it smote such a blow onthe carrier's head that he stretched him on the ground, so stunned thathad he followed it up with a second there would have been no need of asurgeon to cure him. This done, he picked up his armour and returned tohis beat with the same serenity as before.p010.jpg (261K)Full SizeShortly after this, another, not knowing what had happened (for thecarrier still lay senseless), came with the same object of giving waterto his mules, and was proceeding to remove the armour in order to clearthe trough, when Don Quixote, without uttering a word or imploring aidfrom anyone, once more dropped his buckler and once more lifted hislance, and without actually breaking the second carrier's head intopieces, made more than three of it, for he laid it open in four. At thenoise all the people of the inn ran to the spot, and among them thelandlord. Seeing this, Don Quixote braced his buckler on his arm, andwith his hand on his sword exclaimed, "O Lady of Beauty, strength andsupport of my faint heart, it is time for thee to turn the eyes of thygreatness on this thy captive knight on the brink of so mighty anadventure." By this he felt himself so inspired that he would not haveflinched if all the carriers in the world had assailed him. Thecomrades of the wounded perceiving the plight they were in began from adistance to shower stones on Don Quixote, who screened himself as besthe could with his buckler, not daring to quit the trough and leave hisarmour unprotected. The landlord shouted to them to leave him alone,for he had already told them that he was mad, and as a madman he wouldnot be accountable even if he killed them all. Still louder shouted DonQuixote, calling them knaves and traitors, and the lord of the castle,who allowed knights-errant to be treated in this fashion, a villain anda low-born knight whom, had he received the order of knighthood, hewould call to account for his treachery. "But of you," he cried, "baseand vile rabble, I make no account; fling, strike, come on, do all yecan against me, ye shall see what the reward of your folly andinsolence will be." This he uttered with so much spirit and boldnessthat he filled his assailants with a terrible fear, and as much forthis reason as at the persuasion of the landlord they left off stoninghim, and he allowed them to carry off the wounded, and with the samecalmness and composure as before resumed the watch over his armour.But these freaks of his guest were not much to the liking of thelandlord, so he determined to cut matters short and confer upon him atonce the unlucky order of knighthood before any further misadventurecould occur; so, going up to him, he apologised for the rudeness which,without his knowledge, had been offered to him by these low people,who, however, had been well punished for their audacity. As he hadalready told him, he said, there was no chapel in the castle, nor wasit needed for what remained to be done, for, as he understood theceremonial of the order, the whole point of being dubbed a knight layin the accolade and in the slap on the shoulder, and that could beadministered in the middle of a field; and that he had now done allthat was needful as to watching the armour, for all requirements weresatisfied by a watch of two hours only, while he had been more thanfour about it. Don Quixote believed it all, and told him he stood thereready to obey him, and to make an end of it with as much despatch aspossible; for, if he were again attacked, and felt himself to be dubbedknight, he would not, he thought, leave a soul alive in the castle,except such as out of respect he might spare at his bidding.Thus warned and menaced, the castellan forthwith brought out a book inwhich he used to enter the straw and barley he served out to thecarriers, and, with a lad carrying a candle-end, and the two damselsalready mentioned, he returned to where Don Quixote stood, and bade himkneel down. Then, reading from his account-book as if he were repeatingsome devout prayer, in the middle of his delivery he raised his handand gave him a sturdy blow on the neck, and then, with his own sword, asmart slap on the shoulder, all the while muttering between his teethas if he was saying his prayers. Having done this, he directed one ofthe ladies to gird on his sword, which she did with greatself-possession and gravity, and not a little was required to prevent aburst of laughter at each stage of the ceremony; but what they hadalready seen of the novice knight's prowess kept their laughter withinbounds. On girding him with the sword the worthy lady said to him, "MayGod make your worship a very fortunate knight, and grant you success inbattle." Don Quixote asked her name in order that he might from thattime forward know to whom he was beholden for the favour he hadreceived, as he meant to confer upon her some portion of the honour heacquired by the might of his arm. She answered with great humility thatshe was called La Tolosa, and that she was the daughter of a cobbler ofToledo who lived in the stalls of Sanchobienaya, and that wherever shemight be she would serve and esteem him as her lord. Don Quixote saidin reply that she would do him a favour if thenceforward she assumedthe "Don" and called herself Dona Tolosa. She promised she would, andthen the other buckled on his spur, and with her followed almost thesame conversation as with the lady of the sword. He asked her name, andshe said it was La Molinera, and that she was the daughter of arespectable miller of Antequera; and of her likewise Don Quixoterequested that she would adopt the "Don" and call herself DonaMolinera, making offers to her further services and favours.Having thus, with hot haste and speed, brought to a conclusion thesenever-till-now-seen ceremonies, Don Quixote was on thorns until he sawhimself on horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures; andsaddling Rocinante at once he mounted, and embracing his host, as hereturned thanks for his kindness in knighting him, he addressed him inlanguage so extraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of itor report it. The landlord, to get him out of the inn, replied with noless rhetoric though with shorter words, and without calling upon himto pay the reckoning let him go with a Godspeed.p017.jpg (54K)Full SizeCHAPTER IV.OF WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR KNIGHT WHEN HE LEFT THE INNp018.jpg (94K)Full SizeDay was dawning when Don Quixote quitted the inn, so happy, so gay, soexhilarated at finding himself now dubbed a knight, that his joy waslike to burst his horse-girths. However, recalling the advice of hishost as to the requisites he ought to carry with him, especially thatreferring to money and shirts, he determined to go home and providehimself with all, and also with a squire, for he reckoned upon securinga farm-labourer, a neighbour of his, a poor man with a family, but verywell qualified for the office of squire to a knight. With this objecthe turned his horse's head towards his village, and Rocinante, thusreminded of his old quarters, stepped out so briskly that he hardlyseemed to tread the earth.He had not gone far, when out of a thicket on his right there seemed tocome feeble cries as of someone in distress, and the instant he heardthem he exclaimed, "Thanks be to heaven for the favour it accords me,that it so soon offers me an opportunity of fulfilling the obligation Ihave undertaken, and gathering the fruit of my ambition. These cries,no doubt, come from some man or woman in want of help, and needing myaid and protection;" and wheeling, he turned Rocinante in the directionwhence the cries seemed to proceed. He had gone but a few paces intothe wood, when he saw a mare tied to an oak, and tied to another, andstripped from the waist upwards, a youth of about fifteen years of age,from whom the cries came. Nor were they without cause, for a lustyfarmer was flogging him with a belt and following up every blow withscoldings and commands, repeating, "Your mouth shut and your eyesopen!" while the youth made answer, "I won't do it again, master mine;by God's passion I won't do it again, and I'll take more care of theflock another time."Seeing what was going on, Don Quixote said in an angry voice,"Discourteous knight, it ill becomes you to assail one who cannotdefend himself; mount your steed and take your lance" (for there was alance leaning against the oak to which the mare was tied), "and I willmake you know that you are behaving as a coward." The farmer, seeingbefore him this figure in full armour brandishing a lance over hishead, gave himself up for dead, and made answer meekly, "Sir Knight,this youth that I am chastising is my servant, employed by me to watcha flock of sheep that I have hard by, and he is so careless that I loseone every day, and when I punish him for his carelessness and knaveryhe says I do it out of niggardliness, to escape paying him the wages Iowe him, and before God, and on my soul, he lies.""Lies before me, base clown!" said Don Quixote. "By the sun that shineson us I have a mind to run you through with this lance. Pay him at oncewithout another word; if not, by the God that rules us I will make anend of you, and annihilate you on the spot; release him instantly."p019.jpg (339K)Full SizeThe farmer hung his head, and without a word untied his servant, ofwhom Don Quixote asked how much his master owed him.He replied, nine months at seven reals a month. Don Quixote added itup, found that it came to sixty-three reals, and told the farmer to payit down immediately, if he did not want to die for it.The trembling clown replied that as he lived and by the oath he hadsworn (though he had not sworn any) it was not so much; for there wereto be taken into account and deducted three pairs of shoes he had givenhim, and a real for two blood-lettings when he was sick."All that is very well," said Don Quixote; "but let the shoes and theblood-lettings stand as a setoff against the blows you have given himwithout any cause; for if he spoiled the leather of the shoes you paidfor, you have damaged that of his body, and if the barber took bloodfrom him when he was sick, you have drawn it when he was sound; so onthat score he owes you nothing.""The difficulty is, Sir Knight, that I have no money here; let Andrescome home with me, and I will pay him all, real by real.""I go with him!" said the youth. "Nay, God forbid! No, senor, not forthe world; for once alone with me, he would ray me like a SaintBartholomew.""He will do nothing of the kind," said Don Quixote; "I have only tocommand, and he will obey me; and as he has sworn to me by the order ofknighthood which he has received, I leave him free, and I guarantee thepayment.""Consider what you are saying, senor," said the youth; "this master ofmine is not a knight, nor has he received any order of knighthood; forhe is Juan Haldudo the Rich, of Quintanar.""That matters little," replied Don Quixote; "there may be Haldudosknights; moreover, everyone is the son of his works.""That is true," said Andres; "but this master of mine--of what works ishe the son, when he refuses me the wages of my sweat and labour?""I do not refuse, brother Andres," said the farmer, "be good enough tocome along with me, and I swear by all the orders of knighthood thereare in the world to pay you as I have agreed, real by real, andperfumed.""For the perfumery I excuse you," said Don Quixote; "give it to him inreals, and I shall be satisfied; and see that you do as you have sworn;if not, by the same oath I swear to come back and hunt you out andpunish you; and I shall find you though you should lie closer than alizard. And if you desire to know who it is lays this command upon you,that you be more firmly bound to obey it, know that I am the valorousDon Quixote of La Mancha, the undoer of wrongs and injustices; and so,God be with you, and keep in mind what you have promised and swornunder those penalties that have been already declared to you."So saying, he gave Rocinante the spur and was soon out of reach. Thefarmer followed him with his eyes, and when he saw that he had clearedthe wood and was no longer in sight, he turned to his boy Andres, andsaid, "Come here, my son, I want to pay you what I owe you, as thatundoer of wrongs has commanded me.""My oath on it," said Andres, "your worship will be well advised toobey the command of that good knight--may he live a thousand years--for,as he is a valiant and just judge, by Roque, if you do not pay me, hewill come back and do as he said.""My oath on it, too," said the farmer; "but as I have a strongaffection for you, I want to add to the debt in order to add to thepayment;" and seizing him by the arm, he tied him up again, and gavehim such a flogging that he left him for dead."Now, Master Andres," said the farmer, "call on the undoer of wrongs;you will find he won't undo that, though I am not sure that I havequite done with you, for I have a good mind to flay you alive." But atlast he untied him, and gave him leave to go look for his judge inorder to put the sentence pronounced into execution.Andres went off rather down in the mouth, swearing he would go to lookfor the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha and tell him exactly what hadhappened, and that all would have to be repaid him sevenfold; but forall that, he went off weeping, while his master stood laughing.Thus did the valiant Don Quixote right that wrong, and, thoroughlysatisfied with what had taken place, as he considered he had made avery happy and noble beginning with his knighthood, he took the roadtowards his village in perfect self-content, saying in a low voice,"Well mayest thou this day call thyself fortunate above all on earth, ODulcinea del Toboso, fairest of the fair! since it has fallen to thylot to hold subject and submissive to thy full will and pleasure aknight so renowned as is and will be Don Quixote of La Mancha, who, asall the world knows, yesterday received the order of knighthood, andhath to-day righted the greatest wrong and grievance that everinjustice conceived and cruelty perpetrated: who hath to-day pluckedthe rod from the hand of yonder ruthless oppressor so wantonly lashingthat tender child."He now came to a road branching in four directions, and immediately hewas reminded of those cross-roads where knights-errant used to stop toconsider which road they should take. In imitation of them he haltedfor a while, and after having deeply considered it, he gave Rocinantehis head, submitting his own will to that of his hack, who followed outhis first intention, which was to make straight for his own stable.After he had gone about two miles Don Quixote perceived a large partyof people, who, as afterwards appeared, were some Toledo traders, ontheir way to buy silk at Murcia. There were six of them coming alongunder their sunshades, with four servants mounted, and three muleteerson foot. Scarcely had Don Quixote descried them when the fancypossessed him that this must be some new adventure; and to help him toimitate as far as he could those passages he had read of in his books,here seemed to come one made on purpose, which he resolved to attempt.So with a lofty bearing and determination he fixed himself firmly inhis stirrups, got his lance ready, brought his buckler before hisbreast, and planting himself in the middle of the road, stood waitingthe approach of these knights-errant, for such he now considered andheld them to be; and when they had come near enough to see and hear, heexclaimed with a haughty gesture, "All the world stand, unless all theworld confess that in all the world there is no maiden fairer than theEmpress of La Mancha, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso."The traders halted at the sound of this language and the sight of thestrange figure that uttered it, and from both figure and language atonce guessed the craze of their owner; they wished, however, to learnquietly what was the object of this confession that was demanded ofthem, and one of them, who was rather fond of a joke and was verysharp-witted, said to him, "Sir Knight, we do not know who this goodlady is that you speak of; show her to us, for, if she be of suchbeauty as you suggest, with all our hearts and without any pressure wewill confess the truth that is on your part required of us.""If I were to show her to you," replied Don Quixote, "what merit wouldyou have in confessing a truth so manifest? The essential point is thatwithout seeing her you must believe, confess, affirm, swear, and defendit; else ye have to do with me in battle, ill-conditioned, arrogantrabble that ye are; and come ye on, one by one as the order ofknighthood requires, or all together as is the custom and vile usage ofyour breed, here do I bide and await you relying on the justice of thecause I maintain.""Sir Knight," replied the trader, "I entreat your worship in the nameof this present company of princes, that, to save us from charging ourconsciences with the confession of a thing we have never seen or heardof, and one moreover so much to the prejudice of the Empresses andQueens of the Alcarria and Estremadura, your worship will be pleased toshow us some portrait of this lady, though it be no bigger than a grainof wheat; for by the thread one gets at the ball, and in this way weshall be satisfied and easy, and you will be content and pleased; nay,I believe we are already so far agreed with you that even though herportrait should show her blind of one eye, and distilling vermilion andsulphur from the other, we would nevertheless, to gratify your worship,say all in her favour that you desire.""She distils nothing of the kind, vile rabble," said Don Quixote,burning with rage, "nothing of the kind, I say, only ambergris andcivet in cotton; nor is she one-eyed or humpbacked, but straighter thana Guadarrama spindle: but ye must pay for the blasphemy ye have utteredagainst beauty like that of my lady."And so saying, he charged with levelled lance against the one who hadspoken, with such fury and fierceness that, if luck had not contrivedthat Rocinante should stumble midway and come down, it would have gonehard with the rash trader. Down went Rocinante, and over went hismaster, rolling along the ground for some distance; and when he triedto rise he was unable, so encumbered was he with lance, buckler, spurs,helmet, and the weight of his old armour; and all the while he wasstruggling to get up he kept saying, "Fly not, cowards and caitiffs!stay, for not by my fault, but my horse's, am I stretched here."p020.jpg (352K)Full SizeOne of the muleteers in attendance, who could not have had much goodnature in him, hearing the poor prostrate man blustering in this style,was unable to refrain from giving him an answer on his ribs; and comingup to him he seized his lance, and having broken it in pieces, with oneof them he began so to belabour our Don Quixote that, notwithstandingand in spite of his armour, he milled him like a measure of wheat. Hismasters called out not to lay on so hard and to leave him alone, butthe muleteer's blood was up, and he did not care to drop the game untilhe had vented the rest of his wrath, and gathering up the remainingfragments of the lance he finished with a discharge upon the unhappyvictim, who all through the storm of sticks that rained on him neverceased threatening heaven, and earth, and the brigands, for such theyseemed to him. At last the muleteer was tired, and the traderscontinued their journey, taking with them matter for talk about thepoor fellow who had been cudgelled. He when he found himself alone madeanother effort to rise; but if he was unable when whole and sound, howwas he to rise after having been thrashed and well-nigh knocked topieces? And yet he esteemed himself fortunate, as it seemed to him thatthis was a regular knight-errant's mishap, and entirely, he considered,the fault of his horse. However, battered in body as he was, to risewas beyond his power.e04.jpg (28K)CHAPTER V.IN WHICH THE NARRATIVE OF OUR KNIGHT'S MISHAP IS CONTINUEDp022.jpg (123K)Full SizeFinding, then, that, in fact he could not move, he thought himself ofhaving recourse to his usual remedy, which was to think of some passagein his books, and his craze brought to his mind that about Baldwin andthe Marquis of Mantua, when Carloto left him wounded on themountainside, a story known by heart by the children, not forgotten bythe young men, and lauded and even believed by the old folk; and forall that not a whit truer than the miracles of Mahomet. This seemed tohim to fit exactly the case in which he found himself, so, making ashow of severe suffering, he began to roll on the ground and withfeeble breath repeat the very words which the wounded knight of thewood is said to have uttered:Where art thou, lady mine, that thouMy sorrow dost not rue?Thou canst not know it, lady mine,Or else thou art untrue.And so he went on with the ballad as far as the lines:O noble Marquis of Mantua,My Uncle and liege lord!p026.jpg (316K)Full SizeAs chance would have it, when he had got to this line there happened tocome by a peasant from his own village, a neighbour of his, who hadbeen with a load of wheat to the mill, and he, seeing the man stretchedthere, came up to him and asked him who he was and what was the matterwith him that he complained so dolefully.Don Quixote was firmly persuaded that this was the Marquis of Mantua,his uncle, so the only answer he made was to go on with his ballad, inwhich he told the tale of his misfortune, and of the loves of theEmperor's son and his wife all exactly as the ballad sings it.The peasant stood amazed at hearing such nonsense, and relieving him ofthe visor, already battered to pieces by blows, he wiped his face,which was covered with dust, and as soon as he had done so herecognised him and said, "Senor Quixada" (for so he appears to havebeen called when he was in his senses and had not yet changed from aquiet country gentleman into a knight-errant), "who has brought yourworship to this pass?" But to all questions the other only went on withhis ballad.Seeing this, the good man removed as well as he could his breastplateand backpiece to see if he had any wound, but he could perceive noblood nor any mark whatever. He then contrived to raise him from theground, and with no little difficulty hoisted him upon his ass, whichseemed to him to be the easiest mount for him; and collecting the arms,even to the splinters of the lance, he tied them on Rocinante, andleading him by the bridle and the ass by the halter he took the roadfor the village, very sad to hear what absurd stuff Don Quixote wastalking.p029.jpg (285K)Full SizeNor was Don Quixote less so, for what with blows and bruises he couldnot sit upright on the ass, and from time to time he sent up sighs toheaven, so that once more he drove the peasant to ask what ailed him.And it could have been only the devil himself that put into his headtales to match his own adventures, for now, forgetting Baldwin, hebethought himself of the Moor Abindarraez, when the Alcaide ofAntequera, Rodrigo de Narvaez, took him prisoner and carried him awayto his castle; so that when the peasant again asked him how he was andwhat ailed him, he gave him for reply the same words and phrases thatthe captive Abindarraez gave to Rodrigo de Narvaez, just as he had readthe story in the "Diana" of Jorge de Montemayor where it is written,applying it to his own case so aptly that the peasant went alongcursing his fate that he had to listen to such a lot of nonsense; fromwhich, however, he came to the conclusion that his neighbour was mad,and so made all haste to reach the village to escape the wearisomenessof this harangue of Don Quixote's; who, at the end of it, said, "SenorDon Rodrigo de Narvaez, your worship must know that this fair Xarifa Ihave mentioned is now the lovely Dulcinea del Toboso, for whom I havedone, am doing, and will do the most famous deeds of chivalry that inthis world have been seen, are to be seen, or ever shall be seen."To this the peasant answered, "Senor--sinner that I am!--cannot yourworship see that I am not Don Rodrigo de Narvaez nor the Marquis ofMantua, but Pedro Alonso your neighbour, and that your worship isneither Baldwin nor Abindarraez, but the worthy gentleman SenorQuixada?""I know who I am," replied Don Quixote, "and I know that I may be notonly those I have named, but all the Twelve Peers of France and evenall the Nine Worthies, since my achievements surpass all that they havedone all together and each of them on his own account."With this talk and more of the same kind they reached the village justas night was beginning to fall, but the peasant waited until it was alittle later that the belaboured gentleman might not be seen riding insuch a miserable trim. When it was what seemed to him the proper timehe entered the village and went to Don Quixote's house, which he foundall in confusion, and there were the curate and the village barber, whowere great friends of Don Quixote, and his housekeeper was saying tothem in a loud voice, "What does your worship think can have befallenmy master, Senor Licentiate Pero Perez?" for so the curate was called;"it is three days now since anything has been seen of him, or the hack,or the buckler, lance, or armour. Miserable me! I am certain of it, andit is as true as that I was born to die, that these accursed books ofchivalry he has, and has got into the way of reading so constantly,have upset his reason; for now I remember having often heard him sayingto himself that he would turn knight-errant and go all over the worldin quest of adventures. To the devil and Barabbas with such books, thathave brought to ruin in this way the finest understanding there was inall La Mancha!"The niece said the same, and, more: "You must know, MasterNicholas"--for that was the name of the barber--"it was often my uncle'sway to stay two days and nights together poring over these unholy booksof misventures, after which he would fling the book away and snatch uphis sword and fall to slashing the walls; and when he was tired out hewould say he had killed four giants like four towers; and the sweatthat flowed from him when he was weary he said was the blood of thewounds he had received in battle; and then he would drink a great jugof cold water and become calm and quiet, saying that this water was amost precious potion which the sage Esquife, a great magician andfriend of his, had brought him. But I take all the blame upon myselffor never having told your worships of my uncle's vagaries, that youmight put a stop to them before things had come to this pass, and burnall these accursed books--for he has a great number--that richly deserveto be burned like heretics.""So say I too," said the curate, "and by my faith to-morrow shall notpass without public judgment upon them, and may they be condemned tothe flames lest they lead those that read to behave as my good friendseems to have behaved."All this the peasant heard, and from it he understood at last what wasthe matter with his neighbour, so he began calling aloud, "Open, yourworships, to Senor Baldwin and to Senor the Marquis of Mantua, whocomes badly wounded, and to Senor Abindarraez, the Moor, whom thevaliant Rodrigo de Narvaez, the Alcaide of Antequera, brings captive."At these words they all hurried out, and when they recognised theirfriend, master, and uncle, who had not yet dismounted from the assbecause he could not, they ran to embrace him."Hold!" said he, "for I am badly wounded through my horse's fault;carry me to bed, and if possible send for the wise Urganda to cure andsee to my wounds.""See there! plague on it!" cried the housekeeper at this: "did not myheart tell the truth as to which foot my master went lame of? To bedwith your worship at once, and we will contrive to cure you herewithout fetching that Hurgada. A curse I say once more, and a hundredtimes more, on those books of chivalry that have brought your worshipto such a pass."They carried him to bed at once, and after searching for his woundscould find none, but he said they were all bruises from having had asevere fall with his horse Rocinante when in combat with ten giants,the biggest and the boldest to be found on earth."So, so!" said the curate, "are there giants in the dance? By the signof the Cross I will burn them to-morrow before the day is over."They put a host of questions to Don Quixote, but his only answer to allwas--give him something to eat, and leave him to sleep, for that waswhat he needed most. They did so, and the curate questioned the peasantat great length as to how he had found Don Quixote. He told him, andthe nonsense he had talked when found and on the way home, all whichmade the licentiate the more eager to do what he did the next day,which was to summon his friend the barber, Master Nicholas, and go withhim to Don Quixote's house.p031.jpg (31K)CHAPTER VI.OF THE DIVERTING AND IMPORTANT SCRUTINY WHICH THE CURATE AND THE BARBERMADE IN THE LIBRARY OF OUR INGENIOUS GENTLEMANc06a.jpg (92K)Full SizeHe was still sleeping; so the curate asked the niece for the keys ofthe room where the books, the authors of all the mischief, were, andright willingly she gave them. They all went in, the housekeeper withthem, and found more than a hundred volumes of big books very wellbound, and some other small ones. The moment the housekeeper saw themshe turned about and ran out of the room, and came back immediatelywith a saucer of holy water and a sprinkler, saying, "Here, yourworship, senor licentiate, sprinkle this room; don't leave any magicianof the many there are in these books to bewitch us in revenge for ourdesign of banishing them from the world."The simplicity of the housekeeper made the licentiate laugh, and hedirected the barber to give him the books one by one to see what theywere about, as there might be some to be found among them that did notdeserve the penalty of fire."No," said the niece, "there is no reason for showing mercy to any ofthem; they have every one of them done mischief; better fling them outof the window into the court and make a pile of them and set fire tothem; or else carry them into the yard, and there a bonfire can be madewithout the smoke giving any annoyance." The housekeeper said the same,so eager were they both for the slaughter of those innocents, but thecurate would not agree to it without first reading at any rate thetitles.The first that Master Nicholas put into his hand was "The four books ofAmadis of Gaul." "This seems a mysterious thing," said the curate,"for, as I have heard say, this was the first book of chivalry printedin Spain, and from this all the others derive their birth and origin;so it seems to me that we ought inexorably to condemn it to the flamesas the founder of so vile a sect.""Nay, sir," said the barber, "I too, have heard say that this is thebest of all the books of this kind that have been written, and so, assomething singular in its line, it ought to be pardoned.""True," said the curate; "and for that reason let its life be sparedfor the present. Let us see that other which is next to it.""It is," said the barber, "the 'Sergas de Esplandian,' the lawful sonof Amadis of Gaul.""Then verily," said the curate, "the merit of the father must not beput down to the account of the son. Take it, mistress housekeeper; openthe window and fling it into the yard and lay the foundation of thepile for the bonfire we are to make."The housekeeper obeyed with great satisfaction, and the worthy"Esplandian" went flying into the yard to await with all patience thefire that was in store for him."Proceed," said the curate."This that comes next," said the barber, "is 'Amadis of Greece,' and,indeed, I believe all those on this side are of the same Amadislineage.""Then to the yard with the whole of them," said the curate; "for tohave the burning of Queen Pintiquiniestra, and the shepherd Darinel andhis eclogues, and the bedevilled and involved discourses of his author,I would burn with them the father who begot me if he were going aboutin the guise of a knight-errant.""I am of the same mind," said the barber."And so am I," added the niece."In that case," said the housekeeper, "here, into the yard with them!"They were handed to her, and as there were many of them, she sparedherself the staircase, and flung them down out of the window."Who is that tub there?" said the curate."This," said the barber, "is 'Don Olivante de Laura.'""The author of that book," said the curate, "was the same that wrote'The Garden of Flowers,' and truly there is no deciding which of thetwo books is the more truthful, or, to put it better, the less lying;all I can say is, send this one into the yard for a swaggering fool.""This that follows is 'Florismarte of Hircania,'" said the barber."Senor Florismarte here?" said the curate; "then by my faith he musttake up his quarters in the yard, in spite of his marvellous birth andvisionary adventures, for the stiffness and dryness of his styledeserve nothing else; into the yard with him and the other, mistresshousekeeper.""With all my heart, senor," said she, and executed the order with greatdelight."This," said the barber, "is 'The Knight Platir.'""An old book that," said the curate, "but I find no reason for clemencyin it; send it after the others without appeal;" which was done.Another book was opened, and they saw it was entitled, "The Knight ofthe Cross.""For the sake of the holy name this book has," said the curate, "itsignorance might be excused; but then, they say, 'behind the crossthere's the devil;' to the fire with it."Taking down another book, the barber said, "This is 'The Mirror ofChivalry.'""I know his worship," said the curate; "that is where Senor Reinaldosof Montalvan figures with his friends and comrades, greater thievesthan Cacus, and the Twelve Peers of France with the veracious historianTurpin; however, I am not for condemning them to more than perpetualbanishment, because, at any rate, they have some share in the inventionof the famous Matteo Boiardo, whence too the Christian poet LudovicoAriosto wove his web, to whom, if I find him here, and speaking anylanguage but his own, I shall show no respect whatever; but if hespeaks his own tongue I will put him upon my head.""Well, I have him in Italian," said the barber, "but I do notunderstand him.""Nor would it be well that you should understand him," said the curate,"and on that score we might have excused the Captain if he had notbrought him into Spain and turned him into Castilian. He robbed him ofa great deal of his natural force, and so do all those who try to turnbooks written in verse into another language, for, with all the painsthey take and all the cleverness they show, they never can reach thelevel of the originals as they were first produced. In short, I saythat this book, and all that may be found treating of those Frenchaffairs, should be thrown into or deposited in some dry well, untilafter more consideration it is settled what is to be done with them;excepting always one 'Bernardo del Carpio' that is going about, andanother called 'Roncesvalles;' for these, if they come into my hands,shall pass at once into those of the housekeeper, and from hers intothe fire without any reprieve."To all this the barber gave his assent, and looked upon it as right andproper, being persuaded that the curate was so staunch to the Faith andloyal to the Truth that he would not for the world say anything opposedto them. Opening another book he saw it was "Palmerin de Oliva," andbeside it was another called "Palmerin of England," seeing which thelicentiate said, "Let the Olive be made firewood of at once and burneduntil no ashes even are left; and let that Palm of England be kept andpreserved as a thing that stands alone, and let such another case bemade for it as that which Alexander found among the spoils of Dariusand set aside for the safe keeping of the works of the poet Homer. Thisbook, gossip, is of authority for two reasons, first because it is verygood, and secondly because it is said to have been written by a wiseand witty king of Portugal. All the adventures at the Castle ofMiraguarda are excellent and of admirable contrivance, and the languageis polished and clear, studying and observing the style befitting thespeaker with propriety and judgment. So then, provided it seems good toyou, Master Nicholas, I say let this and 'Amadis of Gaul' be remittedthe penalty of fire, and as for all the rest, let them perish withoutfurther question or query.""Nay, gossip," said the barber, "for this that I have here is thefamous 'Don Belianis.'""Well," said the curate, "that and the second, third, and fourth partsall stand in need of a little rhubarb to purge their excess of bile,and they must be cleared of all that stuff about the Castle of Fame andother greater affectations, to which end let them be allowed theover-seas term, and, according as they mend, so shall mercy or justicebe meted out to them; and in the mean time, gossip, do you keep them inyour house and let no one read them.""With all my heart," said the barber; and not caring to tire himselfwith reading more books of chivalry, he told the housekeeper to takeall the big ones and throw them into the yard. It was not said to onedull or deaf, but to one who enjoyed burning them more than weaving thebroadest and finest web that could be; and seizing about eight at atime, she flung them out of the window.In carrying so many together she let one fall at the feet of thebarber, who took it up, curious to know whose it was, and found itsaid, "History of the Famous Knight, Tirante el Blanco.""God bless me!" said the curate with a shout, "'Tirante el Blanco'here! Hand it over, gossip, for in it I reckon I have found a treasuryof enjoyment and a mine of recreation. Here is Don Kyrieleison ofMontalvan, a valiant knight, and his brother Thomas of Montalvan, andthe knight Fonseca, with the battle the bold Tirante fought with themastiff, and the witticisms of the damsel Placerdemivida, and the lovesand wiles of the widow Reposada, and the empress in love with thesquire Hipolito--in truth, gossip, by right of its style it is the bestbook in the world. Here knights eat and sleep, and die in their beds,and make their wills before dying, and a great deal more of which thereis nothing in all the other books. Nevertheless, I say he who wrote it,for deliberately composing such fooleries, deserves to be sent to thegalleys for life. Take it home with you and read it, and you will seethat what I have said is true.""As you will," said the barber; "but what are we to do with theselittle books that are left?""These must be, not chivalry, but poetry," said the curate; and openingone he saw it was the "Diana" of Jorge de Montemayor, and, supposingall the others to be of the same sort, "these," he said, "do notdeserve to be burned like the others, for they neither do nor can dothe mischief the books of chivalry have done, being books ofentertainment that can hurt no one.""Ah, senor!" said the niece, "your worship had better order these to beburned as well as the others; for it would be no wonder if, after beingcured of his chivalry disorder, my uncle, by reading these, took afancy to turn shepherd and range the woods and fields singing andpiping; or, what would be still worse, to turn poet, which they say isan incurable and infectious malady.""The damsel is right," said the curate, "and it will be well to putthis stumbling-block and temptation out of our friend's way. To begin,then, with the 'Diana' of Montemayor. I am of opinion it should not beburned, but that it should be cleared of all that about the sageFelicia and the magic water, and of almost all the longer pieces ofverse: let it keep, and welcome, its prose and the honour of being thefirst of books of the kind.""This that comes next," said the barber, "is the 'Diana,' entitled the'Second Part, by the Salamancan,' and this other has the same title,and its author is Gil Polo.""As for that of the Salamancan," replied the curate, "let it go toswell the number of the condemned in the yard, and let Gil Polo's bepreserved as if it came from Apollo himself: but get on, gossip, andmake haste, for it is growing late.""This book," said the barber, opening another, "is the ten books of the'Fortune of Love,' written by Antonio de Lofraso, a Sardinian poet.""By the orders I have received," said the curate, "since Apollo hasbeen Apollo, and the Muses have been Muses, and poets have been poets,so droll and absurd a book as this has never been written, and in itsway it is the best and the most singular of all of this species thathave as yet appeared, and he who has not read it may be sure he hasnever read what is delightful. Give it here, gossip, for I make moreaccount of having found it than if they had given me a cassock ofFlorence stuff."He put it aside with extreme satisfaction, and the barber went on,"These that come next are 'The Shepherd of Iberia,' 'Nymphs ofHenares,' and 'The Enlightenment of Jealousy.'""Then all we have to do," said the curate, "is to hand them over to thesecular arm of the housekeeper, and ask me not why, or we shall neverhave done.""This next is the 'Pastor de Filida.'""No Pastor that," said the curate, "but a highly polished courtier; letit be preserved as a precious jewel.""This large one here," said the barber, "is called 'The Treasury ofvarious Poems.'""If there were not so many of them," said the curate, "they would bemore relished: this book must be weeded and cleansed of certainvulgarities which it has with its excellences; let it be preservedbecause the author is a friend of mine, and out of respect for othermore heroic and loftier works that he has written.""This," continued the barber, "is the 'Cancionero' of Lopez deMaldonado.""The author of that book, too," said the curate, "is a great friend ofmine, and his verses from his own mouth are the admiration of all whohear them, for such is the sweetness of his voice that he enchants whenhe chants them: it gives rather too much of its eclogues, but what isgood was never yet plentiful: let it be kept with those that have beenset apart. But what book is that next it?""The 'Galatea' of Miguel de Cervantes," said the barber."That Cervantes has been for many years a great friend of mine, and tomy knowledge he has had more experience in reverses than in verses. Hisbook has some good invention in it, it presents us with something butbrings nothing to a conclusion: we must wait for the Second Part itpromises: perhaps with amendment it may succeed in winning the fullmeasure of grace that is now denied it; and in the mean time do you,senor gossip, keep it shut up in your own quarters.""Very good," said the barber; "and here come three together, the'Araucana' of Don Alonso de Ercilla, the 'Austriada' of Juan Rufo,Justice of Cordova, and the 'Montserrate' of Christobal de Virues, theValencian poet.""These three books," said the curate, "are the best that have beenwritten in Castilian in heroic verse, and they may compare with themost famous of Italy; let them be preserved as the richest treasures ofpoetry that Spain possesses."The curate was tired and would not look into any more books, and so hedecided that, "contents uncertified," all the rest should be burned;but just then the barber held open one, called "The Tears of Angelica.""I should have shed tears myself," said the curate when he heard thetitle, "had I ordered that book to be burned, for its author was one ofthe famous poets of the world, not to say of Spain, and was very happyin the translation of some of Ovid's fables."c06e.jpg (30K)CHAPTER VII.OF THE SECOND SALLY OF OUR WORTHY KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHAc07a.jpg (151K)Full SizeAt this instant Don Quixote began shouting out, "Here, here, valiantknights! here is need for you to put forth the might of your strongarms, for they of the Court are gaining the mastery in the tourney!"Called away by this noise and outcry, they proceeded no farther withthe scrutiny of the remaining books, and so it is thought that "TheCarolea," "The Lion of Spain," and "The Deeds of the Emperor," writtenby Don Luis de Avila, went to the fire unseen and unheard; for no doubtthey were among those that remained, and perhaps if the curate had seenthem they would not have undergone so severe a sentence.When they reached Don Quixote he was already out of bed, and was stillshouting and raving, and slashing and cutting all round, as wide awakeas if he had never slept.They closed with him and by force got him back to bed, and when he hadbecome a little calm, addressing the curate, he said to him, "Of atruth, Senor Archbishop Turpin, it is a great disgrace for us who callourselves the Twelve Peers, so carelessly to allow the knights of theCourt to gain the victory in this tourney, we the adventurers havingcarried off the honour on the three former days.""Hush, gossip," said the curate; "please God, the luck may turn, andwhat is lost to-day may be won to-morrow; for the present let yourworship have a care of your health, for it seems to me that you areover-fatigued, if not badly wounded.""Wounded no," said Don Quixote, "but bruised and battered no doubt, forthat bastard Don Roland has cudgelled me with the trunk of an oak tree,and all for envy, because he sees that I alone rival him in hisachievements. But I should not call myself Reinaldos of Montalvan didhe not pay me for it in spite of all his enchantments as soon as I risefrom this bed. For the present let them bring me something to eat, forthat, I feel, is what will be more to my purpose, and leave it to me toavenge myself."They did as he wished; they gave him something to eat, and once more hefell asleep, leaving them marvelling at his madness.That night the housekeeper burned to ashes all the books that were inthe yard and in the whole house; and some must have been consumed thatdeserved preservation in everlasting archives, but their fate and thelaziness of the examiner did not permit it, and so in them was verifiedthe proverb that the innocent suffer for the guilty.One of the remedies which the curate and the barber immediately appliedto their friend's disorder was to wall up and plaster the room wherethe books were, so that when he got up he should not find them(possibly the cause being removed the effect might cease), and theymight say that a magician had carried them off, room and all; and thiswas done with all despatch. Two days later Don Quixote got up, and thefirst thing he did was to go and look at his books, and not finding theroom where he had left it, he wandered from side to side looking forit. He came to the place where the door used to be, and tried it withhis hands, and turned and twisted his eyes in every direction withoutsaying a word; but after a good while he asked his housekeeperwhereabouts was the room that held his books.The housekeeper, who had been already well instructed in what she wasto answer, said, "What room or what nothing is it that your worship islooking for? There are neither room nor books in this house now, forthe devil himself has carried all away.""It was not the devil," said the niece, "but a magician who came on acloud one night after the day your worship left this, and dismountingfrom a serpent that he rode he entered the room, and what he did thereI know not, but after a little while he made off, flying through theroof, and left the house full of smoke; and when we went to see what hehad done we saw neither book nor room: but we remember very well, thehousekeeper and I, that on leaving, the old villain said in a loudvoice that, for a private grudge he owed the owner of the books and theroom, he had done mischief in that house that would be discoveredby-and-by: he said too that his name was the Sage Munaton.""He must have said Friston," said Don Quixote."I don't know whether he called himself Friston or Friton," said thehousekeeper, "I only know that his name ended with 'ton.'""So it does," said Don Quixote, "and he is a sage magician, a greatenemy of mine, who has a spite against me because he knows by his artsand lore that in process of time I am to engage in single combat with aknight whom he befriends and that I am to conquer, and he will beunable to prevent it; and for this reason he endeavours to do me allthe ill turns that he can; but I promise him it will be hard for him tooppose or avoid what is decreed by Heaven.""Who doubts that?" said the niece; "but, uncle, who mixes you up inthese quarrels? Would it not be better to remain at peace in your ownhouse instead of roaming the world looking for better bread than evercame of wheat, never reflecting that many go for wool and come backshorn?""Oh, niece of mine," replied Don Quixote, "how much astray art thou inthy reckoning: ere they shear me I shall have plucked away and strippedoff the beards of all who dare to touch only the tip of a hair ofmine."The two were unwilling to make any further answer, as they saw that hisanger was kindling.In short, then, he remained at home fifteen days very quietly withoutshowing any signs of a desire to take up with his former delusions, andduring this time he held lively discussions with his two gossips, thecurate and the barber, on the point he maintained, that knights-errantwere what the world stood most in need of, and that in him was to beaccomplished the revival of knight-errantry. The curate sometimescontradicted him, sometimes agreed with him, for if he had not observedthis precaution he would have been unable to bring him to reason.Meanwhile Don Quixote worked upon a farm labourer, a neighbour of his,an honest man (if indeed that title can be given to him who is poor),but with very little wit in his pate. In a word, he so talked him over,and with such persuasions and promises, that the poor clown made up hismind to sally forth with him and serve him as esquire. Don Quixote,among other things, told him he ought to be ready to go with himgladly, because any moment an adventure might occur that might win anisland in the twinkling of an eye and leave him governor of it. Onthese and the like promises Sancho Panza (for so the labourer wascalled) left wife and children, and engaged himself as esquire to hisneighbour.c07b.jpg (322K)Full SizeDon Quixote next set about getting some money; and selling one thingand pawning another, and making a bad bargain in every case, he gottogether a fair sum. He provided himself with a buckler, which hebegged as a loan from a friend, and, restoring his battered helmet asbest he could, he warned his squire Sancho of the day and hour he meantto set out, that he might provide himself with what he thought mostneedful. Above all, he charged him to take alforjas with him. The othersaid he would, and that he meant to take also a very good ass he had,as he was not much given to going on foot. About the ass, Don Quixotehesitated a little, trying whether he could call to mind anyknight-errant taking with him an esquire mounted on ass-back, but noinstance occurred to his memory. For all that, however, he determinedto take him, intending to furnish him with a more honourable mount whena chance of it presented itself, by appropriating the horse of thefirst discourteous knight he encountered. Himself he provided withshirts and such other things as he could, according to the advice thehost had given him; all which being done, without taking leave, SanchoPanza of his wife and children, or Don Quixote of his housekeeper andniece, they sallied forth unseen by anybody from the village one night,and made such good way in the course of it that by daylight they heldthemselves safe from discovery, even should search be made for them.Sancho rode on his ass like a patriarch, with his alforjas and bota,and longing to see himself soon governor of the island his master hadpromised him. Don Quixote decided upon taking the same route and roadhe had taken on his first journey, that over the Campo de Montiel,which he travelled with less discomfort than on the last occasion, for,as it was early morning and the rays of the sun fell on them obliquely,the heat did not distress them.And now said Sancho Panza to his master, "Your worship will take care,Senor Knight-errant, not to forget about the island you have promisedme, for be it ever so big I'll be equal to governing it."To which Don Quixote replied, "Thou must know, friend Sancho Panza,that it was a practice very much in vogue with the knights-errant ofold to make their squires governors of the islands or kingdoms theywon, and I am determined that there shall be no failure on my part inso liberal a custom; on the contrary, I mean to improve upon it, forthey sometimes, and perhaps most frequently, waited until their squireswere old, and then when they had had enough of service and hard daysand worse nights, they gave them some title or other, of count, or atthe most marquis, of some valley or province more or less; but if thoulivest and I live, it may well be that before six days are over, I mayhave won some kingdom that has others dependent upon it, which will bejust the thing to enable thee to be crowned king of one of them. Norneedst thou count this wonderful, for things and chances fall to thelot of such knights in ways so unexampled and unexpected that I mighteasily give thee even more than I promise thee.""In that case," said Sancho Panza, "if I should become a king by one ofthose miracles your worship speaks of, even Juana Gutierrez, my oldwoman, would come to be queen and my children infantes.""Well, who doubts it?" said Don Quixote."I doubt it," replied Sancho Panza, "because for my part I am persuadedthat though God should shower down kingdoms upon earth, not one of themwould fit the head of Mari Gutierrez. Let me tell you, senor, she isnot worth two maravedis for a queen; countess will fit her better, andthat only with God's help.""Leave it to God, Sancho," returned Don Quixote, "for he will give herwhat suits her best; but do not undervalue thyself so much as to cometo be content with anything less than being governor of a province.""I will not, senor," answered Sancho, "specially as I have a man ofsuch quality for a master in your worship, who will know how to give meall that will be suitable for me and that I can bear."c07e.jpg (70K)CHAPTER VIII.OF THE GOOD FORTUNE WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE HAD IN THE TERRIBLEAND UNDREAMT-OF ADVENTURE OF THE WINDMILLS, WITH OTHER OCCURRENCESWORTHY TO BE FITLY RECORDEDc08a.jpg (142K)Full SizeAt this point they came in sight of thirty or forty windmills thatthere are on that plain, and as soon as Don Quixote saw them he said tohis squire, "Fortune is arranging matters for us better than we couldhave shaped our desires ourselves, for look there, friend Sancho Panza,where thirty or more monstrous giants present themselves, all of whom Imean to engage in battle and slay, and with whose spoils we shall beginto make our fortunes; for this is righteous warfare, and it is God'sgood service to sweep so evil a breed from off the face of the earth.""What giants?" said Sancho Panza."Those thou seest there," answered his master, "with the long arms, andsome have them nearly two leagues long.""Look, your worship," said Sancho; "what we see there are not giantsbut windmills, and what seem to be their arms are the sails that turnedby the wind make the millstone go.""It is easy to see," replied Don Quixote, "that thou art not used tothis business of adventures; those are giants; and if thou art afraid,away with thee out of this and betake thyself to prayer while I engagethem in fierce and unequal combat."So saying, he gave the spur to his steed Rocinante, heedless of thecries his squire Sancho sent after him, warning him that most certainlythey were windmills and not giants he was going to attack. He, however,was so positive they were giants that he neither heard the cries ofSancho, nor perceived, near as he was, what they were, but made at themshouting, "Fly not, cowards and vile beings, for a single knightattacks you."A slight breeze at this moment sprang up, and the great sails began tomove, seeing which Don Quixote exclaimed, "Though ye flourish more armsthan the giant Briareus, ye have to reckon with me."So saying, and commending himself with all his heart to his ladyDulcinea, imploring her to support him in such a peril, with lance inrest and covered by his buckler, he charged at Rocinante's fullestgallop and fell upon the first mill that stood in front of him; but ashe drove his lance-point into the sail the wind whirled it round withsuch force that it shivered the lance to pieces, sweeping with it horseand rider, who went rolling over on the plain, in a sorry condition.Sancho hastened to his assistance as fast as his ass could go, and whenhe came up found him unable to move, with such a shock had Rocinantefallen with him.c08b.jpg (358K)Full Size"God bless me!" said Sancho, "did I not tell your worship to mind whatyou were about, for they were only windmills? and no one could havemade any mistake about it but one who had something of the same kind inhis head.""Hush, friend Sancho," replied Don Quixote, "the fortunes of war morethan any other are liable to frequent fluctuations; and moreover Ithink, and it is the truth, that that same sage Friston who carried offmy study and books, has turned these giants into mills in order to robme of the glory of vanquishing them, such is the enmity he bears me;but in the end his wicked arts will avail but little against my goodsword."c08c.jpg (301K)Full Size"God order it as he may," said Sancho Panza, and helping him to risegot him up again on Rocinante, whose shoulder was half out; and then,discussing the late adventure, they followed the road to Puerto Lapice,for there, said Don Quixote, they could not fail to find adventures inabundance and variety, as it was a great thoroughfare. For all that, hewas much grieved at the loss of his lance, and saying so to his squire,he added, "I remember having read how a Spanish knight, Diego Perez deVargas by name, having broken his sword in battle, tore from an oak aponderous bough or branch, and with it did such things that day, andpounded so many Moors, that he got the surname of Machuca, and he andhis descendants from that day forth were called Vargas y Machuca. Imention this because from the first oak I see I mean to rend suchanother branch, large and stout like that, with which I am determinedand resolved to do such deeds that thou mayest deem thyself veryfortunate in being found worthy to come and see them, and be aneyewitness of things that will with difficulty be believed.""Be that as God will," said Sancho, "I believe it all as your worshipsays it; but straighten yourself a little, for you seem all on oneside, may be from the shaking of the fall.""That is the truth," said Don Quixote, "and if I make no complaint ofthe pain it is because knights-errant are not permitted to complain ofany wound, even though their bowels be coming out through it.""If so," said Sancho, "I have nothing to say; but God knows I wouldrather your worship complained when anything ailed you. For my part, Iconfess I must complain however small the ache may be; unless this ruleabout not complaining extends to the squires of knights-errant also."Don Quixote could not help laughing at his squire's simplicity, and heassured him he might complain whenever and however he chose, just as heliked, for, so far, he had never read of anything to the contrary inthe order of knighthood.Sancho bade him remember it was dinner-time, to which his masteranswered that he wanted nothing himself just then, but that _he_ mighteat when he had a mind. With this permission Sancho settled himself ascomfortably as he could on his beast, and taking out of the alforjaswhat he had stowed away in them, he jogged along behind his mastermunching deliberately, and from time to time taking a pull at the botawith a relish that the thirstiest tapster in Malaga might have envied;and while he went on in this way, gulping down draught after draught,he never gave a thought to any of the promises his master had made him,nor did he rate it as hardship but rather as recreation going in questof adventures, however dangerous they might be. Finally they passed thenight among some trees, from one of which Don Quixote plucked a drybranch to serve him after a fashion as a lance, and fixed on it thehead he had removed from the broken one. All that night Don Quixote layawake thinking of his lady Dulcinea, in order to conform to what he hadread in his books, how many a night in the forests and deserts knightsused to lie sleepless supported by the memory of their mistresses. Notso did Sancho Panza spend it, for having his stomach full of somethingstronger than chicory water he made but one sleep of it, and, if hismaster had not called him, neither the rays of the sun beating on hisface nor all the cheery notes of the birds welcoming the approach ofday would have had power to waken him. On getting up he tried the botaand found it somewhat less full than the night before, which grievedhis heart because they did not seem to be on the way to remedy thedeficiency readily. Don Quixote did not care to break his fast, for, ashas been already said, he confined himself to savoury recollections fornourishment.They returned to the road they had set out with, leading to PuertoLapice, and at three in the afternoon they came in sight of it. "Here,brother Sancho Panza," said Don Quixote when he saw it, "we may plungeour hands up to the elbows in what they call adventures; but observe,even shouldst thou see me in the greatest danger in the world, thoumust not put a hand to thy sword in my defence, unless indeed thouperceivest that those who assail me are rabble or base folk; for inthat case thou mayest very properly aid me; but if they be knights itis on no account permitted or allowed thee by the laws of knighthood tohelp me until thou hast been dubbed a knight.""Most certainly, senor," replied Sancho, "your worship shall be fullyobeyed in this matter; all the more as of myself I am peaceful and nofriend to mixing in strife and quarrels: it is true that as regards thedefence of my own person I shall not give much heed to those laws, forlaws human and divine allow each one to defend himself against anyassailant whatever.""That I grant," said Don Quixote, "but in this matter of aiding meagainst knights thou must put a restraint upon thy naturalimpetuosity.""I will do so, I promise you," answered Sancho, "and will keep thisprecept as carefully as Sunday."While they were thus talking there appeared on the road two friars ofthe order of St. Benedict, mounted on two dromedaries, for not lesstall were the two mules they rode on. They wore travelling spectaclesand carried sunshades; and behind them came a coach attended by four orfive persons on horseback and two muleteers on foot. In the coach therewas, as afterwards appeared, a Biscay lady on her way to Seville, whereher husband was about to take passage for the Indies with anappointment of high honour. The friars, though going the same road,were not in her company; but the moment Don Quixote perceived them hesaid to his squire, "Either I am mistaken, or this is going to be themost famous adventure that has ever been seen, for those black bodieswe see there must be, and doubtless are, magicians who are carrying offsome stolen princess in that coach, and with all my might I must undothis wrong.""This will be worse than the windmills," said Sancho. "Look, senor;those are friars of St. Benedict, and the coach plainly belongs to sometravellers: I tell you to mind well what you are about and don't letthe devil mislead you.""I have told thee already, Sancho," replied Don Quixote, "that on thesubject of adventures thou knowest little. What I say is the truth, asthou shalt see presently."So saying, he advanced and posted himself in the middle of the roadalong which the friars were coming, and as soon as he thought they hadcome near enough to hear what he said, he cried aloud, "Devilish andunnatural beings, release instantly the highborn princesses whom youare carrying off by force in this coach, else prepare to meet a speedydeath as the just punishment of your evil deeds."The friars drew rein and stood wondering at the appearance of DonQuixote as well as at his words, to which they replied, "SenorCaballero, we are not devilish or unnatural, but two brothers of St.Benedict following our road, nor do we know whether or not there areany captive princesses coming in this coach.""No soft words with me, for I know you, lying rabble," said DonQuixote, and without waiting for a reply he spurred Rocinante and withlevelled lance charged the first friar with such fury anddetermination, that, if the friar had not flung himself off the mule,he would have brought him to the ground against his will, and sorewounded, if not killed outright. The second brother, seeing how hiscomrade was treated, drove his heels into his castle of a mule and madeoff across the country faster than the wind.Sancho Panza, when he saw the friar on the ground, dismounting brisklyfrom his ass, rushed towards him and began to strip off his gown. Atthat instant the friars' muleteers came up and asked what he wasstripping him for. Sancho answered them that this fell to him lawfullyas spoil of the battle which his lord Don Quixote had won. Themuleteers, who had no idea of a joke and did not understand all thisabout battles and spoils, seeing that Don Quixote was some distance offtalking to the travellers in the coach, fell upon Sancho, knocked himdown, and leaving hardly a hair in his beard, belaboured him with kicksand left him stretched breathless and senseless on the ground; andwithout any more delay helped the friar to mount, who, trembling,terrified, and pale, as soon as he found himself in the saddle, spurredafter his companion, who was standing at a distance looking on,watching the result of the onslaught; then, not caring to wait for theend of the affair just begun, they pursued their journey making morecrosses than if they had the devil after them.Don Quixote was, as has been said, speaking to the lady in the coach:"Your beauty, lady mine," said he, "may now dispose of your person asmay be most in accordance with your pleasure, for the pride of yourravishers lies prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine;and lest you should be pining to know the name of your deliverer, knowthat I am called Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant andadventurer, and captive to the peerless and beautiful lady Dulcinea delToboso: and in return for the service you have received of me I ask nomore than that you should return to El Toboso, and on my behalf presentyourself before that lady and tell her what I have done to set youfree."One of the squires in attendance upon the coach, a Biscayan, waslistening to all Don Quixote was saying, and, perceiving that he wouldnot allow the coach to go on, but was saying it must return at once toEl Toboso, he made at him, and seizing his lance addressed him in badCastilian and worse Biscayan after his fashion, "Begone, caballero, andill go with thee; by the God that made me, unless thou quittest coach,slayest thee as art here a Biscayan."Don Quixote understood him quite well, and answered him very quietly,"If thou wert a knight, as thou art none, I should have alreadychastised thy folly and rashness, miserable creature." To which theBiscayan returned, "I no gentleman!--I swear to God thou liest as I amChristian: if thou droppest lance and drawest sword, soon shalt thousee thou art carrying water to the cat: Biscayan on land, hidalgo atsea, hidalgo at the devil, and look, if thou sayest otherwise thouliest.""'"You will see presently," said Agrajes,'" replied Don Quixote; andthrowing his lance on the ground he drew his sword, braced his buckleron his arm, and attacked the Biscayan, bent upon taking his life.The Biscayan, when he saw him coming on, though he wished to dismountfrom his mule, in which, being one of those sorry ones let out forhire, he had no confidence, had no choice but to draw his sword; it waslucky for him, however, that he was near the coach, from which he wasable to snatch a cushion that served him for a shield; and they went atone another as if they had been two mortal enemies. The others stroveto make peace between them, but could not, for the Biscayan declared inhis disjointed phrase that if they did not let him finish his battle hewould kill his mistress and everyone that strove to prevent him. Thelady in the coach, amazed and terrified at what she saw, ordered thecoachman to draw aside a little, and set herself to watch this severestruggle, in the course of which the Biscayan smote Don Quixote amighty stroke on the shoulder over the top of his buckler, which, givento one without armour, would have cleft him to the waist. Don Quixote,feeling the weight of this prodigious blow, cried aloud, saying, "Olady of my soul, Dulcinea, flower of beauty, come to the aid of thisyour knight, who, in fulfilling his obligations to your beauty, findshimself in this extreme peril." To say this, to lift his sword, toshelter himself well behind his buckler, and to assail the Biscayan wasthe work of an instant, determined as he was to venture all upon asingle blow. The Biscayan, seeing him come on in this way, wasconvinced of his courage by his spirited bearing, and resolved tofollow his example, so he waited for him keeping well under cover ofhis cushion, being unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre with hismule, which, dead tired and never meant for this kind of game, couldnot stir a step.On, then, as aforesaid, came Don Quixote against the wary Biscayan,with uplifted sword and a firm intention of splitting him in half,while on his side the Biscayan waited for him sword in hand, and underthe protection of his cushion; and all present stood trembling, waitingin suspense the result of blows such as threatened to fall, and thelady in the coach and the rest of her following were making a thousandvows and offerings to all the images and shrines of Spain, that Godmight deliver her squire and all of them from this great peril in whichthey found themselves. But it spoils all, that at this point and crisisthe author of the history leaves this battle impending, giving asexcuse that he could find nothing more written about these achievementsof Don Quixote than what has been already set forth. It is true thesecond author of this work was unwilling to believe that a history socurious could have been allowed to fall under the sentence of oblivion,or that the wits of La Mancha could have been so undiscerning as not topreserve in their archives or registries some documents referring tothis famous knight; and this being his persuasion, he did not despairof finding the conclusion of this pleasant history, which, heavenfavouring him, he did find in a way that shall be related in the SecondPart.c08e.jpg (54K)CHAPTER IX.IN WHICH IS CONCLUDED AND FINISHED THE TERRIFIC BATTLE BETWEEN THEGALLANT BISCAYAN AND THE VALIANT MANCHEGANc09a.jpg (142K)Full SizeIn the First Part of this history we left the valiant Biscayan and therenowned Don Quixote with drawn swords uplifted, ready to deliver twosuch furious slashing blows that if they had fallen full and fair theywould at least have split and cleft them asunder from top to toe andlaid them open like a pomegranate; and at this so critical point thedelightful history came to a stop and stood cut short without anyintimation from the author where what was missing was to be found.This distressed me greatly, because the pleasure derived from havingread such a small portion turned to vexation at the thought of the poorchance that presented itself of finding the large part that, so itseemed to me, was missing of such an interesting tale. It appeared tome to be a thing impossible and contrary to all precedent that so gooda knight should have been without some sage to undertake the task ofwriting his marvellous achievements; a thing that was never wanting toany of those knights-errant who, they say, went after adventures; forevery one of them had one or two sages as if made on purpose, who notonly recorded their deeds but described their most trifling thoughtsand follies, however secret they might be; and such a good knight couldnot have been so unfortunate as not to have what Platir and others likehim had in abundance. And so I could not bring myself to believe thatsuch a gallant tale had been left maimed and mutilated, and I laid theblame on Time, the devourer and destroyer of all things, that hadeither concealed or consumed it.On the other hand, it struck me that, inasmuch as among his books therehad been found such modern ones as "The Enlightenment of Jealousy" andthe "Nymphs and Shepherds of Henares," his story must likewise bemodern, and that though it might not be written, it might exist in thememory of the people of his village and of those in the neighbourhood.This reflection kept me perplexed and longing to know really and trulythe whole life and wondrous deeds of our famous Spaniard, Don Quixoteof La Mancha, light and mirror of Manchegan chivalry, and the firstthat in our age and in these so evil days devoted himself to the labourand exercise of the arms of knight-errantry, righting wrongs,succouring widows, and protecting damsels of that sort that used toride about, whip in hand, on their palfreys, with all their virginityabout them, from mountain to mountain and valley to valley--for, if itwere not for some ruffian, or boor with a hood and hatchet, ormonstrous giant, that forced them, there were in days of yore damselsthat at the end of eighty years, in all which time they had never slepta day under a roof, went to their graves as much maids as the mothersthat bore them. I say, then, that in these and other respects ourgallant Don Quixote is worthy of everlasting and notable praise, norshould it be withheld even from me for the labour and pains spent insearching for the conclusion of this delightful history; though I knowwell that if Heaven, chance and good fortune had not helped me, theworld would have remained deprived of an entertainment and pleasurethat for a couple of hours or so may well occupy him who shall read itattentively. The discovery of it occurred in this way.One day, as I was in the Alcana of Toledo, a boy came up to sell somepamphlets and old papers to a silk mercer, and, as I am fond of readingeven the very scraps of paper in the streets, led by this natural bentof mine I took up one of the pamphlets the boy had for sale, and sawthat it was in characters which I recognised as Arabic, and as I wasunable to read them though I could recognise them, I looked about tosee if there were any Spanish-speaking Morisco at hand to read them forme; nor was there any great difficulty in finding such an interpreter,for even had I sought one for an older and better language I shouldhave found him. In short, chance provided me with one, who when I toldhim what I wanted and put the book into his hands, opened it in themiddle and after reading a little in it began to laugh. I asked himwhat he was laughing at, and he replied that it was at something thebook had written in the margin by way of a note. I bade him tell it tome; and he still laughing said, "In the margin, as I told you, this iswritten: '_This Dulcinea del Toboso so often mentioned in this history,had, they say, the best hand of any woman in all La Mancha for saltingpigs_.'"When I heard Dulcinea del Toboso named, I was struck with surprise andamazement, for it occurred to me at once that these pamphlets containedthe history of Don Quixote. With this idea I pressed him to read thebeginning, and doing so, turning the Arabic offhand into Castilian, hetold me it meant, "_History of Don Quixote of La Mancha, written by CidHamete Benengeli, an Arab historian_." It required great caution tohide the joy I felt when the title of the book reached my ears, andsnatching it from the silk mercer, I bought all the papers andpamphlets from the boy for half a real; and if he had had his witsabout him and had known how eager I was for them, he might have safelycalculated on making more than six reals by the bargain. I withdrew atonce with the Morisco into the cloister of the cathedral, and beggedhim to turn all these pamphlets that related to Don Quixote into theCastilian tongue, without omitting or adding anything to them, offeringhim whatever payment he pleased. He was satisfied with two arrobas ofraisins and two bushels of wheat, and promised to translate themfaithfully and with all despatch; but to make the matter easier, andnot to let such a precious find out of my hands, I took him to myhouse, where in little more than a month and a half he translated thewhole just as it is set down here.In the first pamphlet the battle between Don Quixote and the Biscayanwas drawn to the very life, they planted in the same attitude as thehistory describes, their swords raised, and the one protected by hisbuckler, the other by his cushion, and the Biscayan's mule so true tonature that it could be seen to be a hired one a bowshot off. TheBiscayan had an inscription under his feet which said, "_Don Sancho deAzpeitia_," which no doubt must have been his name; and at the feet ofRocinante was another that said, "_Don Quixote_." Rocinante wasmarvellously portrayed, so long and thin, so lank and lean, with somuch backbone and so far gone in consumption, that he showed plainlywith what judgment and propriety the name of Rocinante had beenbestowed upon him. Near him was Sancho Panza holding the halter of hisass, at whose feet was another label that said, "Sancho Zancas," andaccording to the picture, he must have had a big belly, a short body,and long shanks, for which reason, no doubt, the names of Panza andZancas were given him, for by these two surnames the history severaltimes calls him. Some other trifling particulars might be mentioned,but they are all of slight importance and have nothing to do with thetrue relation of the history; and no history can be bad so long as itis true.If against the present one any objection be raised on the score of itstruth, it can only be that its author was an Arab, as lying is a verycommon propensity with those of that nation; though, as they are suchenemies of ours, it is conceivable that there were omissions ratherthan additions made in the course of it. And this is my own opinion;for, where he could and should give freedom to his pen in praise of soworthy a knight, he seems to me deliberately to pass it over insilence; which is ill done and worse contrived, for it is the businessand duty of historians to be exact, truthful, and wholly free frompassion, and neither interest nor fear, hatred nor love, should makethem swerve from the path of truth, whose mother is history, rival oftime, storehouse of deeds, witness for the past, example and counselfor the present, and warning for the future. In this I know will befound all that can be desired in the pleasantest, and if it be wantingin any good quality, I maintain it is the fault of its hound of anauthor and not the fault of the subject. To be brief, its Second Part,according to the translation, began in this way:With trenchant swords upraised and poised on high, it seemed as thoughthe two valiant and wrathful combatants stood threatening heaven, andearth, and hell, with such resolution and determination did they bearthemselves. The fiery Biscayan was the first to strike a blow, whichwas delivered with such force and fury that had not the sword turned inits course, that single stroke would have sufficed to put an end to thebitter struggle and to all the adventures of our knight; but that goodfortune which reserved him for greater things, turned aside the swordof his adversary, so that although it smote him upon the left shoulder,it did him no more harm than to strip all that side of its armour,carrying away a great part of his helmet with half of his ear, allwhich with fearful ruin fell to the ground, leaving him in a sorryplight.Good God! Who is there that could properly describe the rage thatfilled the heart of our Manchegan when he saw himself dealt with inthis fashion? All that can be said is, it was such that he again raisedhimself in his stirrups, and, grasping his sword more firmly with bothhands, he came down on the Biscayan with such fury, smiting him fullover the cushion and over the head, that--even so good a shield provinguseless--as if a mountain had fallen on him, he began to bleed fromnose, mouth, and ears, reeling as if about to fall backwards from hismule, as no doubt he would have done had he not flung his arms aboutits neck; at the same time, however, he slipped his feet out of thestirrups and then unclasped his arms, and the mule, taking fright atthe terrible blow, made off across the plain, and with a few plungesflung its master to the ground. Don Quixote stood looking on verycalmly, and, when he saw him fall, leaped from his horse and with greatbriskness ran to him, and, presenting the point of his sword to hiseyes, bade him surrender, or he would cut his head off. The Biscayanwas so bewildered that he was unable to answer a word, and it wouldhave gone hard with him, so blind was Don Quixote, had not the ladiesin the coach, who had hitherto been watching the combat in greatterror, hastened to where he stood and implored him with earnestentreaties to grant them the great grace and favour of sparing theirsquire's life; to which Don Quixote replied with much gravity anddignity, "In truth, fair ladies, I am well content to do what ye ask ofme; but it must be on one condition and understanding, which is thatthis knight promise me to go to the village of El Toboso, and on mybehalf present himself before the peerless lady Dulcinea, that she dealwith him as shall be most pleasing to her."The terrified and disconsolate ladies, without discussing Don Quixote'sdemand or asking who Dulcinea might be, promised that their squireshould do all that had been commanded."Then, on the faith of that promise," said Don Quixote, "I shall do himno further harm, though he well deserves it of me."c09e.jpg (61K)Full SizeCHAPTER X.OF THE PLEASANT DISCOURSE THAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HISSQUIRE SANCHO PANZAc10a.jpg (91K)Full SizeNow by this time Sancho had risen, rather the worse for the handling ofthe friars' muleteers, and stood watching the battle of his master, DonQuixote, and praying to God in his heart that it might be his will togrant him the victory, and that he might thereby win some island tomake him governor of, as he had promised. Seeing, therefore, that thestruggle was now over, and that his master was returning to mountRocinante, he approached to hold the stirrup for him, and, before hecould mount, he went on his knees before him, and taking his hand,kissed it saying, "May it please your worship, Senor Don Quixote, togive me the government of that island which has been won in this hardfight, for be it ever so big I feel myself in sufficient force to beable to govern it as much and as well as anyone in the world who hasever governed islands."To which Don Quixote replied, "Thou must take notice, brother Sancho,that this adventure and those like it are not adventures of islands,but of cross-roads, in which nothing is got except a broken head or anear the less: have patience, for adventures will present themselvesfrom which I may make you, not only a governor, but something more."Sancho gave him many thanks, and again kissing his hand and the skirtof his hauberk, helped him to mount Rocinante, and mounting his asshimself, proceeded to follow his master, who at a brisk pace, withouttaking leave, or saying anything further to the ladies belonging to thecoach, turned into a wood that was hard by. Sancho followed him at hisass's best trot, but Rocinante stepped out so that, seeing himself leftbehind, he was forced to call to his master to wait for him. DonQuixote did so, reining in Rocinante until his weary squire came up,who on reaching him said, "It seems to me, senor, it would be prudentin us to go and take refuge in some church, for, seeing how mauled hewith whom you fought has been left, it will be no wonder if they giveinformation of the affair to the Holy Brotherhood and arrest us, and,faith, if they do, before we come out of gaol we shall have to sweatfor it.""Peace," said Don Quixote; "where hast thou ever seen or heard that aknight-errant has been arraigned before a court of justice, howevermany homicides he may have committed?""I know nothing about omecils," answered Sancho, "nor in my life havehad anything to do with one; I only know that the Holy Brotherhoodlooks after those who fight in the fields, and in that other matter Ido not meddle.""Then thou needst have no uneasiness, my friend," said Don Quixote,"for I will deliver thee out of the hands of the Chaldeans, much moreout of those of the Brotherhood. But tell me, as thou livest, hast thouseen a more valiant knight than I in all the known world; hast thouread in history of any who has or had higher mettle in attack, morespirit in maintaining it, more dexterity in wounding or skill inoverthrowing?""The truth is," answered Sancho, "that I have never read any history,for I can neither read nor write, but what I will venture to bet isthat a more daring master than your worship I have never served in allthe days of my life, and God grant that this daring be not paid forwhere I have said; what I beg of your worship is to dress your wound,for a great deal of blood flows from that ear, and I have here somelint and a little white ointment in the alforjas.""All that might be well dispensed with," said Don Quixote, "if I hadremembered to make a vial of the balsam of Fierabras, for time andmedicine are saved by one single drop.""What vial and what balsam is that?" said Sancho Panza."It is a balsam," answered Don Quixote, "the receipt of which I have inmy memory, with which one need have no fear of death, or dread dying ofany wound; and so when I make it and give it to thee thou hast nothingto do when in some battle thou seest they have cut me in half throughthe middle of the body--as is wont to happen frequently--but neatly andwith great nicety, ere the blood congeal, to place that portion of thebody which shall have fallen to the ground upon the other half whichremains in the saddle, taking care to fit it on evenly and exactly.Then thou shalt give me to drink but two drops of the balsam I havementioned, and thou shalt see me become sounder than an apple.""If that be so," said Panza, "I renounce henceforth the government ofthe promised island, and desire nothing more in payment of my many andfaithful services than that your worship give me the receipt of thissupreme liquor, for I am persuaded it will be worth more than two realsan ounce anywhere, and I want no more to pass the rest of my life inease and honour; but it remains to be told if it costs much to makeit.""With less than three reals, six quarts of it may be made," said DonQuixote."Sinner that I am!" said Sancho, "then why does your worship put offmaking it and teaching it to me?""Peace, friend," answered Don Quixote; "greater secrets I mean to teachthee and greater favours to bestow upon thee; and for the present letus see to the dressing, for my ear pains me more than I could wish."Sancho took out some lint and ointment from the alforjas; but when DonQuixote came to see his helmet shattered, he was like to lose hissenses, and clapping his hand upon his sword and raising his eyes toheaven, he said, "I swear by the Creator of all things and the fourGospels in their fullest extent, to do as the great Marquis of Mantuadid when he swore to avenge the death of his nephew Baldwin (and thatwas not to eat bread from a table-cloth, nor embrace his wife, andother points which, though I cannot now call them to mind, I here grantas expressed) until I take complete vengeance upon him who hascommitted such an offence against me."Hearing this, Sancho said to him, "Your worship should bear in mind,Senor Don Quixote, that if the knight has done what was commanded himin going to present himself before my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, he willhave done all that he was bound to do, and does not deserve furtherpunishment unless he commits some new offence."picoCTF{15_y0ur_que57_qu1x071c_0r_h3r01c_9d4ba956}"Thou hast said well and hit the point," answered Don Quixote; and so Irecall the oath in so far as relates to taking fresh vengeance on him,but I make and confirm it anew to lead the life I have said until suchtime as I take by force from some knight another helmet such as thisand as good; and think not, Sancho, that I am raising smoke with strawin doing so, for I have one to imitate in the matter, since the verysame thing to a hair happened in the case of Mambrino's helmet, whichcost Sacripante so dear.""Senor," replied Sancho, "let your worship send all such oaths to thedevil, for they are very pernicious to salvation and prejudicial to theconscience; just tell me now, if for several days to come we fall inwith no man armed with a helmet, what are we to do? Is the oath to beobserved in spite of all the inconvenience and discomfort it will be tosleep in your clothes, and not to sleep in a house, and a thousandother mortifications contained in the oath of that old fool the Marquisof Mantua, which your worship is now wanting to revive? Let yourworship observe that there are no men in armour travelling on any ofthese roads, nothing but carriers and carters, who not only do not wearhelmets, but perhaps never heard tell of them all their lives.""Thou art wrong there," said Don Quixote, "for we shall not have beenabove two hours among these cross-roads before we see more men inarmour than came to Albraca to win the fair Angelica.""Enough," said Sancho; "so be it then, and God grant us success, andthat the time for winning that island which is costing me so dear maysoon come, and then let me die.""I have already told thee, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "not to givethyself any uneasiness on that score; for if an island should fail,there is the kingdom of Denmark, or of Sobradisa, which will fit theeas a ring fits the finger, and all the more that, being on _terrafirma_, thou wilt all the better enjoy thyself. But let us leave thatto its own time; see if thou hast anything for us to eat in thosealforjas, because we must presently go in quest of some castle where wemay lodge to-night and make the balsam I told thee of, for I swear tothee by God, this ear is giving me great pain.""I have here an onion and a little cheese and a few scraps of bread,"said Sancho, "but they are not victuals fit for a valiant knight likeyour worship.""How little thou knowest about it," answered Don Quixote; "I would havethee to know, Sancho, that it is the glory of knights-errant to gowithout eating for a month, and even when they do eat, that it shouldbe of what comes first to hand; and this would have been clear to theehadst thou read as many histories as I have, for, though they are verymany, among them all I have found no mention made of knights-erranteating, unless by accident or at some sumptuous banquets prepared forthem, and the rest of the time they passed in dalliance. And though itis plain they could not do without eating and performing all the othernatural functions, because, in fact, they were men like ourselves, itis plain too that, wandering as they did the most part of their livesthrough woods and wilds and without a cook, their most usual fare wouldbe rustic viands such as those thou now offer me; so that, friendSancho, let not that distress thee which pleases me, and do not seek tomake a new world or pervert knight-errantry.""Pardon me, your worship," said Sancho, "for, as I cannot read orwrite, as I said just now, I neither know nor comprehend the rules ofthe profession of chivalry: henceforward I will stock the alforjas withevery kind of dry fruit for your worship, as you are a knight; and formyself, as I am not one, I will furnish them with poultry and otherthings more substantial.""I do not say, Sancho," replied Don Quixote, "that it is imperative onknights-errant not to eat anything else but the fruits thou speakestof; only that their more usual diet must be those, and certain herbsthey found in the fields which they knew and I know too.""A good thing it is," answered Sancho, "to know those herbs, for to mythinking it will be needful some day to put that knowledge intopractice."And here taking out what he said he had brought, the pair made theirrepast peaceably and sociably. But anxious to find quarters for thenight, they with all despatch made an end of their poor dry fare,mounted at once, and made haste to reach some habitation before nightset in; but daylight and the hope of succeeding in their object failedthem close by the huts of some goatherds, so they determined to passthe night there, and it was as much to Sancho's discontent not to havereached a house, as it was to his master's satisfaction to sleep underthe open heaven, for he fancied that each time this happened to him heperformed an act of ownership that helped to prove his chivalry.c10e.jpg (57K)CHAPTER XI.WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH CERTAIN GOATHERDSc11a.jpg (173K)Full SizeHe was cordially welcomed by the goatherds, and Sancho, having as besthe could put up Rocinante and the ass, drew towards the fragrance thatcame from some pieces of salted goat simmering in a pot on the fire;and though he would have liked at once to try if they were ready to betransferred from the pot to the stomach, he refrained from doing so asthe goatherds removed them from the fire, and laying sheepskins on theground, quickly spread their rude table, and with signs of heartygood-will invited them both to share what they had. Round the skins sixof the men belonging to the fold seated themselves, having first withrough politeness pressed Don Quixote to take a seat upon a trough whichthey placed for him upside down. Don Quixote seated himself, and Sanchoremained standing to serve the cup, which was made of horn. Seeing himstanding, his master said to him:"That thou mayest see, Sancho, the good that knight-errantry containsin itself, and how those who fill any office in it are on the high roadto be speedily honoured and esteemed by the world, I desire that thouseat thyself here at my side and in the company of these worthy people,and that thou be one with me who am thy master and natural lord, andthat thou eat from my plate and drink from whatever I drink from; forthe same may be said of knight-errantry as of love, that it levelsall.""Great thanks," said Sancho, "but I may tell your worship that providedI have enough to eat, I can eat it as well, or better, standing, and bymyself, than seated alongside of an emperor. And indeed, if the truthis to be told, what I eat in my corner without form or fuss has muchmore relish for me, even though it be bread and onions, than theturkeys of those other tables where I am forced to chew slowly, drinklittle, wipe my mouth every minute, and cannot sneeze or cough if Iwant or do other things that are the privileges of liberty andsolitude. So, senor, as for these honours which your worship would putupon me as a servant and follower of knight-errantry, exchange them forother things which may be of more use and advantage to me; for these,though I fully acknowledge them as received, I renounce from thismoment to the end of the world.""For all that," said Don Quixote, "thou must seat thyself, because himwho humbleth himself God exalteth;" and seizing him by the arm heforced him to sit down beside himself.The goatherds did not understand this jargon about squires andknights-errant, and all they did was to eat in silence and stare attheir guests, who with great elegance and appetite were stowing awaypieces as big as one's fist. The course of meat finished, they spreadupon the sheepskins a great heap of parched acorns, and with them theyput down a half cheese harder than if it had been made of mortar. Allthis while the horn was not idle, for it went round so constantly, nowfull, now empty, like the bucket of a water-wheel, that it soon drainedone of the two wine-skins that were in sight. When Don Quixote hadquite appeased his appetite he took up a handful of the acorns, andcontemplating them attentively delivered himself somewhat in thisfashion:"Happy the age, happy the time, to which the ancients gave the name ofgolden, not because in that fortunate age the gold so coveted in thisour iron one was gained without toil, but because they that lived in itknew not the two words "_mine_" and "_thine_"! In that blessed age allthings were in common; to win the daily food no labour was required ofany save to stretch forth his hand and gather it from the sturdy oaksthat stood generously inviting him with their sweet ripe fruit. Theclear streams and running brooks yielded their savoury limpid waters innoble abundance. The busy and sagacious bees fixed their republic inthe clefts of the rocks and hollows of the trees, offering withoutusance the plenteous produce of their fragrant toil to every hand. Themighty cork trees, unenforced save of their own courtesy, shed thebroad light bark that served at first to roof the houses supported byrude stakes, a protection against the inclemency of heaven alone. Thenall was peace, all friendship, all concord; as yet the dull share ofthe crooked plough had not dared to rend and pierce the tender bowelsof our first mother that without compulsion yielded from every portionof her broad fertile bosom all that could satisfy, sustain, and delightthe children that then possessed her. Then was it that the innocent andfair young shepherdess roamed from vale to vale and hill to hill, withflowing locks, and no more garments than were needful modestly to coverwhat modesty seeks and ever sought to hide. Nor were their ornamentslike those in use to-day, set off by Tyrian purple, and silk torturedin endless fashions, but the wreathed leaves of the green dock and ivy,wherewith they went as bravely and becomingly decked as our Court dameswith all the rare and far-fetched artifices that idle curiosity hastaught them. Then the love-thoughts of the heart clothed themselvessimply and naturally as the heart conceived them, nor sought to commendthemselves by forced and rambling verbiage. Fraud, deceit, or malicehad then not yet mingled with truth and sincerity. Justice held herground, undisturbed and unassailed by the efforts of favour and ofinterest, that now so much impair, pervert, and beset her. Arbitrarylaw had not yet established itself in the mind of the judge, for thenthere was no cause to judge and no one to be judged. Maidens andmodesty, as I have said, wandered at will alone and unattended, withoutfear of insult from lawlessness or libertine assault, and if they wereundone it was of their own will and pleasure. But now in this hatefulage of ours not one is safe, not though some new labyrinth like that ofCrete conceal and surround her; even there the pestilence of gallantrywill make its way to them through chinks or on the air by the zeal ofits accursed importunity, and, despite of all seclusion, lead them toruin. In defence of these, as time advanced and wickedness increased,the order of knights-errant was instituted, to defend maidens, toprotect widows and to succour the orphans and the needy. To this orderI belong, brother goatherds, to whom I return thanks for thehospitality and kindly welcome ye offer me and my squire; for though bynatural law all living are bound to show favour to knights-errant, yet,seeing that without knowing this obligation ye have welcomed andfeasted me, it is right that with all the good-will in my power Ishould thank you for yours."c11b.jpg (349K)Full SizeAll this long harangue (which might very well have been spared) ourknight delivered because the acorns they gave him reminded him of thegolden age; and the whim seized him to address all this unnecessaryargument to the goatherds, who listened to him gaping in amazementwithout saying a word in reply. Sancho likewise held his peace and ateacorns, and paid repeated visits to the second wine-skin, which theyhad hung up on a cork tree to keep the wine cool.Don Quixote was longer in talking than the supper in finishing, at theend of which one of the goatherds said, "That your worship, senorknight-errant, may say with more truth that we show you hospitalitywith ready good-will, we will give you amusement and pleasure by makingone of our comrades sing: he will be here before long, and he is a veryintelligent youth and deep in love, and what is more he can read andwrite and play on the rebeck to perfection."The goatherd had hardly done speaking, when the notes of the rebeckreached their ears; and shortly after, the player came up, a verygood-looking young man of about two-and-twenty. His comrades asked himif he had supped, and on his replying that he had, he who had alreadymade the offer said to him:"In that case, Antonio, thou mayest as well do us the pleasure ofsinging a little, that the gentleman, our guest, may see that even inthe mountains and woods there are musicians: we have told him of thyaccomplishments, and we want thee to show them and prove that we saytrue; so, as thou livest, pray sit down and sing that ballad about thylove that thy uncle the prebendary made thee, and that was so muchliked in the town.""With all my heart," said the young man, and without waiting for morepressing he seated himself on the trunk of a felled oak, and tuning hisrebeck, presently began to sing to these words.ANTONIO'S BALLADThou dost love me well, Olalla;Well I know it, even thoughLove's mute tongues, thine eyes, have neverBy their glances told me so.For I know my love thou knowest,Therefore thine to claim I dare:Once it ceases to be secret,Love need never feel despair.True it is, Olalla, sometimesThou hast all too plainly shownThat thy heart is brass in hardness,And thy snowy bosom stone.Yet for all that, in thy coyness,And thy fickle fits between,Hope is there--at least the borderOf her garment may be seen.Lures to faith are they, those glimpses,And to faith in thee I hold;Kindness cannot make it stronger,Coldness cannot make it cold.If it be that love is gentle,In thy gentleness I seeSomething holding out assuranceTo the hope of winning thee.If it be that in devotionLies a power hearts to move,That which every day I show thee,Helpful to my suit should prove.Many a time thou must have noticed--If to notice thou dost care--How I go about on MondayDressed in all my Sunday wear.Love's eyes love to look on brightness;Love loves what is gaily drest;Sunday, Monday, all I care isThou shouldst see me in my best.No account I make of dances,Or of strains that pleased thee so,Keeping thee awake from midnightTill the cocks began to crow;Or of how I roundly swore itThat there's none so fair as thou;True it is, but as I said it,By the girls I'm hated now.For Teresa of the hillsideAt my praise of thee was sore;Said, "You think you love an angel;It's a monkey you adore;"Caught by all her glittering trinkets,And her borrowed braids of hair,And a host of made-up beautiesThat would Love himself ensnare."'Twas a lie, and so I told her,And her cousin at the wordGave me his defiance for it;And what followed thou hast heard.Mine is no high-flown affection,Mine no passion _par amours_--As they call it--what I offerIs an honest love, and pure.Cunning cords the holy Church has,Cords of softest silk they be;Put thy neck beneath the yoke, dear;Mine will follow, thou wilt see.Else--and once for all I swear itBy the saint of most renown--If I ever quit the mountains,'Twill be in a friar's gown.Here the goatherd brought his song to an end, and though Don Quixoteentreated him to sing more, Sancho had no mind that way, being moreinclined for sleep than for listening to songs; so said he to hismaster, "Your worship will do well to settle at once where you mean topass the night, for the labour these good men are at all day does notallow them to spend the night in singing.""I understand thee, Sancho," replied Don Quixote; "I perceive clearlythat those visits to the wine-skin demand compensation in sleep ratherthan in music.""It's sweet to us all, blessed be God," said Sancho."I do not deny it," replied Don Quixote; "but settle thyself where thouwilt; those of my calling are more becomingly employed in watching thanin sleeping; still it would be as well if thou wert to dress this earfor me again, for it is giving me more pain than it need."Sancho did as he bade him, but one of the goatherds, seeing the wound,told him not to be uneasy, as he would apply a remedy with which itwould be soon healed; and gathering some leaves of rosemary, of whichthere was a great quantity there, he chewed them and mixed them with alittle salt, and applying them to the ear he secured them firmly with abandage, assuring him that no other treatment would be required, and soit proved.c11e.jpg (37K)CHAPTER XII.OF WHAT A GOATHERD RELATED TO THOSE WITH DON QUIXOTEc12a.jpg (143K)Full SizeJust then another young man, one of those who fetched their provisionsfrom the village, came up and said, "Do you know what is going on inthe village, comrades?""How could we know it?" replied one of them."Well, then, you must know," continued the young man, "this morningthat famous student-shepherd called Chrysostom died, and it is rumouredthat he died of love for that devil of a village girl the daughter ofGuillermo the Rich, she that wanders about the wolds here in the dressof a shepherdess.""You mean Marcela?" said one."Her I mean," answered the goatherd; "and the best of it is, he hasdirected in his will that he is to be buried in the fields like a Moor,and at the foot of the rock where the Cork-tree spring is, because, asthe story goes (and they say he himself said so), that was the placewhere he first saw her. And he has also left other directions which theclergy of the village say should not and must not be obeyed becausethey savour of paganism. To all which his great friend Ambrosio thestudent, he who, like him, also went dressed as a shepherd, repliesthat everything must be done without any omission according to thedirections left by Chrysostom, and about this the village is all incommotion; however, report says that, after all, what Ambrosio and allthe shepherds his friends desire will be done, and to-morrow they arecoming to bury him with great ceremony where I said. I am sure it willbe something worth seeing; at least I will not fail to go and see iteven if I knew I should not return to the village to-morrow.""We will do the same," answered the goatherds, "and cast lots to seewho must stay to mind the goats of all.""Thou sayest well, Pedro," said one, "though there will be no need oftaking that trouble, for I will stay behind for all; and don't supposeit is virtue or want of curiosity in me; it is that the splinter thatran into my foot the other day will not let me walk.""For all that, we thank thee," answered Pedro.Don Quixote asked Pedro to tell him who the dead man was and who theshepherdess, to which Pedro replied that all he knew was that the deadman was a wealthy gentleman belonging to a village in those mountains,who had been a student at Salamanca for many years, at the end of whichhe returned to his village with the reputation of being very learnedand deeply read. "Above all, they said, he was learned in the scienceof the stars and of what went on yonder in the heavens and the sun andthe moon, for he told us of the cris of the sun and moon to exacttime.""Eclipse it is called, friend, not cris, the darkening of those twoluminaries," said Don Quixote; but Pedro, not troubling himself withtrifles, went on with his story, saying, "Also he foretold when theyear was going to be one of abundance or estility.""Sterility, you mean," said Don Quixote."Sterility or estility," answered Pedro, "it is all the same in theend. And I can tell you that by this his father and friends whobelieved him grew very rich because they did as he advised them,bidding them 'sow barley this year, not wheat; this year you may sowpulse and not barley; the next there will be a full oil crop, and thethree following not a drop will be got.'""That science is called astrology," said Don Quixote."I do not know what it is called," replied Pedro, "but I know that heknew all this and more besides. But, to make an end, not many monthshad passed after he returned from Salamanca, when one day he appeareddressed as a shepherd with his crook and sheepskin, having put off thelong gown he wore as a scholar; and at the same time his great friend,Ambrosio by name, who had been his companion in his studies, took tothe shepherd's dress with him. I forgot to say that Chrysostom, who isdead, was a great man for writing verses, so much so that he madecarols for Christmas Eve, and plays for Corpus Christi, which the youngmen of our village acted, and all said they were excellent. When thevillagers saw the two scholars so unexpectedly appearing in shepherd'sdress, they were lost in wonder, and could not guess what had led themto make so extraordinary a change. About this time the father of ourChrysostom died, and he was left heir to a large amount of property inchattels as well as in land, no small number of cattle and sheep, and alarge sum of money, of all of which the young man was left dissoluteowner, and indeed he was deserving of it all, for he was a very goodcomrade, and kind-hearted, and a friend of worthy folk, and had acountenance like a benediction. Presently it came to be known that hehad changed his dress with no other object than to wander about thesewastes after that shepherdess Marcela our lad mentioned a while ago,with whom the deceased Chrysostom had fallen in love. And I must tellyou now, for it is well you should know it, who this girl is; perhaps,and even without any perhaps, you will not have heard anything like itall the days of your life, though you should live more years thansarna.""Say Sarra," said Don Quixote, unable to endure the goatherd'sconfusion of words."The sarna lives long enough," answered Pedro; "and if, senor, you mustgo finding fault with words at every step, we shall not make an end ofit this twelvemonth.""Pardon me, friend," said Don Quixote; "but, as there is such adifference between sarna and Sarra, I told you of it; however, you haveanswered very rightly, for sarna lives longer than Sarra: so continueyour story, and I will not object any more to anything.""I say then, my dear sir," said the goatherd, "that in our villagethere was a farmer even richer than the father of Chrysostom, who wasnamed Guillermo, and upon whom God bestowed, over and above greatwealth, a daughter at whose birth her mother died, the most respectedwoman there was in this neighbourhood; I fancy I can see her now withthat countenance which had the sun on one side and the moon on theother; and moreover active, and kind to the poor, for which I trustthat at the present moment her soul is in bliss with God in the otherworld. Her husband Guillermo died of grief at the death of so good awife, leaving his daughter Marcela, a child and rich, to the care of anuncle of hers, a priest and prebendary in our village. The girl grew upwith such beauty that it reminded us of her mother's, which was verygreat, and yet it was thought that the daughter's would exceed it; andso when she reached the age of fourteen to fifteen years nobody beheldher but blessed God that had made her so beautiful, and the greaternumber were in love with her past redemption. Her uncle kept her ingreat seclusion and retirement, but for all that the fame of her greatbeauty spread so that, as well for it as for her great wealth, heruncle was asked, solicited, and importuned, to give her in marriage notonly by those of our town but of those many leagues round, and by thepersons of highest quality in them. But he, being a good Christian man,though he desired to give her in marriage at once, seeing her to be oldenough, was unwilling to do so without her consent, not that he had anyeye to the gain and profit which the custody of the girl's propertybrought him while he put off her marriage; and, faith, this was said inpraise of the good priest in more than one set in the town. For I wouldhave you know, Sir Errant, that in these little villages everything istalked about and everything is carped at, and rest assured, as I am,that the priest must be over and above good who forces his parishionersto speak well of him, especially in villages.""That is the truth," said Don Quixote; "but go on, for the story isvery good, and you, good Pedro, tell it with very good grace.""May that of the Lord not be wanting to me," said Pedro; "that is theone to have. To proceed; you must know that though the uncle put beforehis niece and described to her the qualities of each one in particularof the many who had asked her in marriage, begging her to marry andmake a choice according to her own taste, she never gave any otheranswer than that she had no desire to marry just yet, and that being soyoung she did not think herself fit to bear the burden of matrimony. Atthese, to all appearance, reasonable excuses that she made, her uncleceased to urge her, and waited till she was somewhat more advanced inage and could mate herself to her own liking. For, said he--and he saidquite right--parents are not to settle children in life against theirwill. But when one least looked for it, lo and behold! one day thedemure Marcela makes her appearance turned shepherdess; and, in spiteof her uncle and all those of the town that strove to dissuade her,took to going a-field with the other shepherd-lasses of the village,and tending her own flock. And so, since she appeared in public, andher beauty came to be seen openly, I could not well tell you how manyrich youths, gentlemen and peasants, have adopted the costume ofChrysostom, and go about these fields making love to her. One of these,as has been already said, was our deceased friend, of whom they saythat he did not love but adore her. But you must not suppose, becauseMarcela chose a life of such liberty and independence, and of so littleor rather no retirement, that she has given any occasion, or even thesemblance of one, for disparagement of her purity and modesty; on thecontrary, such and so great is the vigilance with which she watchesover her honour, that of all those that court and woo her not one hasboasted, or can with truth boast, that she has given him any hopehowever small of obtaining his desire. For although she does not avoidor shun the society and conversation of the shepherds, and treats themcourteously and kindly, should any one of them come to declare hisintention to her, though it be one as proper and holy as that ofmatrimony, she flings him from her like a catapult. And with this kindof disposition she does more harm in this country than if the plaguehad got into it, for her affability and her beauty draw on the heartsof those that associate with her to love her and to court her, but herscorn and her frankness bring them to the brink of despair; and so theyknow not what to say save to proclaim her aloud cruel and hard-hearted,and other names of the same sort which well describe the nature of hercharacter; and if you should remain here any time, senor, you wouldhear these hills and valleys resounding with the laments of therejected ones who pursue her. Not far from this there is a spot wherethere are a couple of dozen of tall beeches, and there is not one ofthem but has carved and written on its smooth bark the name of Marcela,and above some a crown carved on the same tree as though her loverwould say more plainly that Marcela wore and deserved that of all humanbeauty. Here one shepherd is sighing, there another is lamenting; therelove songs are heard, here despairing elegies. One will pass all thehours of the night seated at the foot of some oak or rock, and there,without having closed his weeping eyes, the sun finds him in themorning bemused and bereft of sense; and another without relief orrespite to his sighs, stretched on the burning sand in the full heat ofthe sultry summer noontide, makes his appeal to the compassionateheavens, and over one and the other, over these and all, the beautifulMarcela triumphs free and careless. And all of us that know her arewaiting to see what her pride will come to, and who is to be the happyman that will succeed in taming a nature so formidable and gainingpossession of a beauty so supreme. All that I have told you being suchwell-established truth, I am persuaded that what they say of the causeof Chrysostom's death, as our lad told us, is the same. And so I adviseyou, senor, fail not to be present to-morrow at his burial, which willbe well worth seeing, for Chrysostom had many friends, and it is nothalf a league from this place to where he directed he should beburied.""I will make a point of it," said Don Quixote, "and I thank you for thepleasure you have given me by relating so interesting a tale.""Oh," said the goatherd, "I do not know even the half of what hashappened to the lovers of Marcela, but perhaps to-morrow we may fall inwith some shepherd on the road who can tell us; and now it will be wellfor you to go and sleep under cover, for the night air may hurt yourwound, though with the remedy I have applied to you there is no fear ofan untoward result."Sancho Panza, who was wishing the goatherd's loquacity at the devil, onhis part begged his master to go into Pedro's hut to sleep. He did so,and passed all the rest of the night in thinking of his lady Dulcinea,in imitation of the lovers of Marcela. Sancho Panza settled himselfbetween Rocinante and his ass, and slept, not like a lover who had beendiscarded, but like a man who had been soundly kicked.c12e.jpg (42K)CHAPTER XIII.IN WHICH IS ENDED THE STORY OF THE SHEPHERDESS MARCELA, WITH OTHERINCIDENTSc13a.jpg (181K)Full SizeBut hardly had day begun to show itself through the balconies of theeast, when five of the six goatherds came to rouse Don Quixote and tellhim that if he was still of a mind to go and see the famous burial ofChrysostom they would bear him company. Don Quixote, who desirednothing better, rose and ordered Sancho to saddle and pannel at once,which he did with all despatch, and with the same they all set outforthwith. They had not gone a quarter of a league when at the meetingof two paths they saw coming towards them some six shepherds dressed inblack sheepskins and with their heads crowned with garlands of cypressand bitter oleander. Each of them carried a stout holly staff in hishand, and along with them there came two men of quality on horseback inhandsome travelling dress, with three servants on foot accompanyingthem. Courteous salutations were exchanged on meeting, and inquiringone of the other which way each party was going, they learned that allwere bound for the scene of the burial, so they went on all together.One of those on horseback addressing his companion said to him, "Itseems to me, Senor Vivaldo, that we may reckon as well spent the delaywe shall incur in seeing this remarkable funeral, for remarkable itcannot but be judging by the strange things these shepherds have toldus, of both the dead shepherd and homicide shepherdess.""So I think too," replied Vivaldo, "and I would delay not to say a day,but four, for the sake of seeing it."Don Quixote asked them what it was they had heard of Marcela andChrysostom. The traveller answered that the same morning they had metthese shepherds, and seeing them dressed in this mournful fashion theyhad asked them the reason of their appearing in such a guise; which oneof them gave, describing the strange behaviour and beauty of ashepherdess called Marcela, and the loves of many who courted her,together with the death of that Chrysostom to whose burial they weregoing. In short, he repeated all that Pedro had related to Don Quixote.This conversation dropped, and another was commenced by him who wascalled Vivaldo asking Don Quixote what was the reason that led him togo armed in that fashion in a country so peaceful. To which Don Quixotereplied, "The pursuit of my calling does not allow or permit me to goin any other fashion; easy life, enjoyment, and repose were inventedfor soft courtiers, but toil, unrest, and arms were invented and madefor those alone whom the world calls knights-errant, of whom I, thoughunworthy, am the least of all."The instant they heard this all set him down as mad, and the better tosettle the point and discover what kind of madness his was, Vivaldoproceeded to ask him what knights-errant meant."Have not your worships," replied Don Quixote, "read the annals andhistories of England, in which are recorded the famous deeds of KingArthur, whom we in our popular Castilian invariably call King Artus,with regard to whom it is an ancient tradition, and commonly receivedall over that kingdom of Great Britain, that this king did not die, butwas changed by magic art into a raven, and that in process of time heis to return to reign and recover his kingdom and sceptre; for whichreason it cannot be proved that from that time to this any Englishmanever killed a raven? Well, then, in the time of this good king thatfamous order of chivalry of the Knights of the Round Table wasinstituted, and the amour of Don Lancelot of the Lake with the QueenGuinevere occurred, precisely as is there related, the go-between andconfidante therein being the highly honourable dame Quintanona, whencecame that ballad so well known and widely spread in our Spain--O never surely was there knight    So served by hand of dame,As served was he Sir Lancelot hight    When he from Britain came--with all the sweet and delectable course of his achievements in loveand war. Handed down from that time, then, this order of chivalry wenton extending and spreading itself over many and various parts of theworld; and in it, famous and renowned for their deeds, were the mightyAmadis of Gaul with all his sons and descendants to the fifthgeneration, and the valiant Felixmarte of Hircania, and the neversufficiently praised Tirante el Blanco, and in our own days almost wehave seen and heard and talked with the invincible knight Don Belianisof Greece. This, then, sirs, is to be a knight-errant, and what I havespoken of is the order of his chivalry, of which, as I have alreadysaid, I, though a sinner, have made profession, and what the aforesaidknights professed that same do I profess, and so I go through thesesolitudes and wilds seeking adventures, resolved in soul to oppose myarm and person to the most perilous that fortune may offer me in aid ofthe weak and needy."By these words of his the travellers were able to satisfy themselves ofDon Quixote's being out of his senses and of the form of madness thatovermastered him, at which they felt the same astonishment that allfelt on first becoming acquainted with it; and Vivaldo, who was aperson of great shrewdness and of a lively temperament, in order tobeguile the short journey which they said was required to reach themountain, the scene of the burial, sought to give him an opportunity ofgoing on with his absurdities. So he said to him, "It seems to me,Senor Knight-errant, that your worship has made choice of one of themost austere professions in the world, and I imagine even that of theCarthusian monks is not so austere.""As austere it may perhaps be," replied our Don Quixote, "but sonecessary for the world I am very much inclined to doubt. For, if thetruth is to be told, the soldier who executes what his captain ordersdoes no less than the captain himself who gives the order. My meaning,is, that churchmen in peace and quiet pray to Heaven for the welfare ofthe world, but we soldiers and knights carry into effect what they prayfor, defending it with the might of our arms and the edge of ourswords, not under shelter but in the open air, a target for theintolerable rays of the sun in summer and the piercing frosts ofwinter. Thus are we God's ministers on earth and the arms by which hisjustice is done therein. And as the business of war and all thatrelates and belongs to it cannot be conducted without exceeding greatsweat, toil, and exertion, it follows that those who make it theirprofession have undoubtedly more labour than those who in tranquilpeace and quiet are engaged in praying to God to help the weak. I donot mean to say, nor does it enter into my thoughts, that theknight-errant's calling is as good as that of the monk in his cell; Iwould merely infer from what I endure myself that it is beyond a doubta more laborious and a more belaboured one, a hungrier and thirstier, awretcheder, raggeder, and lousier; for there is no reason to doubt thatthe knights-errant of yore endured much hardship in the course of theirlives. And if some of them by the might of their arms did rise to beemperors, in faith it cost them dear in the matter of blood and sweat;and if those who attained to that rank had not had magicians and sagesto help them they would have been completely baulked in their ambitionand disappointed in their hopes.""That is my own opinion," replied the traveller; "but one thing amongmany others seems to me very wrong in knights-errant, and that is thatwhen they find themselves about to engage in some mighty and perilousadventure in which there is manifest danger of losing their lives, theynever at the moment of engaging in it think of commending themselves toGod, as is the duty of every good Christian in like peril; instead ofwhich they commend themselves to their ladies with as much devotion asif these were their gods, a thing which seems to me to savour somewhatof heathenism.""Sir," answered Don Quixote, "that cannot be on any account omitted,and the knight-errant would be disgraced who acted otherwise: for it isusual and customary in knight-errantry that the knight-errant, who onengaging in any great feat of arms has his lady before him, should turnhis eyes towards her softly and lovingly, as though with thementreating her to favour and protect him in the hazardous venture he isabout to undertake, and even though no one hear him, he is bound to saycertain words between his teeth, commending himself to her with all hisheart, and of this we have innumerable instances in the histories. Noris it to be supposed from this that they are to omit commendingthemselves to God, for there will be time and opportunity for doing sowhile they are engaged in their task.""For all that," answered the traveller, "I feel some doubt still,because often I have read how words will arise between twoknights-errant, and from one thing to another it comes about that theiranger kindles and they wheel their horses round and take a good stretchof field, and then without any more ado at the top of their speed theycome to the charge, and in mid-career they are wont to commendthemselves to their ladies; and what commonly comes of the encounter isthat one falls over the haunches of his horse pierced through andthrough by his antagonist's lance, and as for the other, it is only byholding on to the mane of his horse that he can help falling to theground; but I know not how the dead man had time to commend himself toGod in the course of such rapid work as this; it would have been betterif those words which he spent in commending himself to his lady in themidst of his career had been devoted to his duty and obligation as aChristian. Moreover, it is my belief that all knights-errant have notladies to commend themselves to, for they are not all in love.""That is impossible," said Don Quixote: "I say it is impossible thatthere could be a knight-errant without a lady, because to such it is asnatural and proper to be in love as to the heavens to have stars: mostcertainly no history has been seen in which there is to be found aknight-errant without an amour, and for the simple reason that withoutone he would be held no legitimate knight but a bastard, and one whohad gained entrance into the stronghold of the said knighthood, not bythe door, but over the wall like a thief and a robber.""Nevertheless," said the traveller, "if I remember rightly, I think Ihave read that Don Galaor, the brother of the valiant Amadis of Gaul,never had any special lady to whom he might commend himself, and yet hewas not the less esteemed, and was a very stout and famous knight."To which our Don Quixote made answer, "Sir, one solitary swallow doesnot make summer; moreover, I know that knight was in secret very deeplyin love; besides which, that way of falling in love with all that tookhis fancy was a natural propensity which he could not control. But, inshort, it is very manifest that he had one alone whom he made mistressof his will, to whom he commended himself very frequently and verysecretly, for he prided himself on being a reticent knight.""Then if it be essential that every knight-errant should be in love,"said the traveller, "it may be fairly supposed that your worship is so,as you are of the order; and if you do not pride yourself on being asreticent as Don Galaor, I entreat you as earnestly as I can, in thename of all this company and in my own, to inform us of the name,country, rank, and beauty of your lady, for she will esteem herselffortunate if all the world knows that she is loved and served by such aknight as your worship seems to be."At this Don Quixote heaved a deep sigh and said, "I cannot saypositively whether my sweet enemy is pleased or not that the worldshould know I serve her; I can only say in answer to what has been socourteously asked of me, that her name is Dulcinea, her country ElToboso, a village of La Mancha, her rank must be at least that of aprincess, since she is my queen and lady, and her beauty superhuman,since all the impossible and fanciful attributes of beauty which thepoets apply to their ladies are verified in her; for her hairs aregold, her forehead Elysian fields, her eyebrows rainbows, her eyessuns, her cheeks roses, her lips coral, her teeth pearls, her neckalabaster, her bosom marble, her hands ivory, her fairness snow, andwhat modesty conceals from sight such, I think and imagine, as rationalreflection can only extol, not compare.""We should like to know her lineage, race, and ancestry," said Vivaldo.To which Don Quixote replied, "She is not of the ancient Roman Curtii,Caii, or Scipios, nor of the modern Colonnas or Orsini, nor of theMoncadas or Requesenes of Catalonia, nor yet of the Rebellas orVillanovas of Valencia; Palafoxes, Nuzas, Rocabertis, Corellas, Lunas,Alagones, Urreas, Foces, or Gurreas of Aragon; Cerdas, Manriques,Mendozas, or Guzmans of Castile; Alencastros, Pallas, or Meneses ofPortugal; but she is of those of El Toboso of La Mancha, a lineage thatthough modern, may furnish a source of gentle blood for the mostillustrious families of the ages that are to come, and this let nonedispute with me save on the condition that Zerbino placed at the footof the trophy of Orlando's arms, saying,    These let none move    Who dareth not his might with Roland prove.""Although mine is of the Cachopins of Laredo," said the traveller, "Iwill not venture to compare it with that of El Toboso of La Mancha,though, to tell the truth, no such surname has until now ever reachedmy ears.""What!" said Don Quixote, "has that never reached them?"The rest of the party went along listening with great attention to theconversation of the pair, and even the very goatherds and shepherdsperceived how exceedingly out of his wits our Don Quixote was. SanchoPanza alone thought that what his master said was the truth, knowingwho he was and having known him from his birth; and all that he feltany difficulty in believing was that about the fair Dulcinea delToboso, because neither any such name nor any such princess had evercome to his knowledge though he lived so close to El Toboso. They weregoing along conversing in this way, when they saw descending a gapbetween two high mountains some twenty shepherds, all clad insheepskins of black wool, and crowned with garlands which, asafterwards appeared, were, some of them of yew, some of cypress. Six ofthe number were carrying a bier covered with a great variety of flowersand branches, on seeing which one of the goatherds said, "Those whocome there are the bearers of Chrysostom's body, and the foot of thatmountain is the place where he ordered them to bury him." Theytherefore made haste to reach the spot, and did so by the time thosewho came had laid the bier upon the ground, and four of them with sharppickaxes were digging a grave by the side of a hard rock. They greetedeach other courteously, and then Don Quixote and those who accompaniedhim turned to examine the bier, and on it, covered with flowers, theysaw a dead body in the dress of a shepherd, to all appearance of onethirty years of age, and showing even in death that in life he had beenof comely features and gallant bearing. Around him on the bier itselfwere laid some books, and several papers open and folded; and those whowere looking on as well as those who were opening the grave and all theothers who were there preserved a strange silence, until one of thosewho had borne the body said to another, "Observe carefully, Ambrosio ifthis is the place Chrysostom spoke of, since you are anxious that whathe directed in his will should be so strictly complied with.""This is the place," answered Ambrosio "for in it many a time did mypoor friend tell me the story of his hard fortune. Here it was, he toldme, that he saw for the first time that mortal enemy of the human race,and here, too, for the first time he declared to her his passion, ashonourable as it was devoted, and here it was that at last Marcelaended by scorning and rejecting him so as to bring the tragedy of hiswretched life to a close; here, in memory of misfortunes so great, hedesired to be laid in the bowels of eternal oblivion." Then turning toDon Quixote and the travellers he went on to say, "That body, sirs, onwhich you are looking with compassionate eyes, was the abode of a soulon which Heaven bestowed a vast share of its riches. That is the bodyof Chrysostom, who was unrivalled in wit, unequalled in courtesy,unapproached in gentle bearing, a phoenix in friendship, generouswithout limit, grave without arrogance, gay without vulgarity, and, inshort, first in all that constitutes goodness and second to none in allthat makes up misfortune. He loved deeply, he was hated; he adored, hewas scorned; he wooed a wild beast, he pleaded with marble, he pursuedthe wind, he cried to the wilderness, he served ingratitude, and forreward was made the prey of death in the mid-course of life, cut shortby a shepherdess whom he sought to immortalise in the memory of man, asthese papers which you see could fully prove, had he not commanded meto consign them to the fire after having consigned his body to theearth.""You would deal with them more harshly and cruelly than their ownerhimself," said Vivaldo, "for it is neither right nor proper to do thewill of one who enjoins what is wholly unreasonable; it would not havebeen reasonable in Augustus Caesar had he permitted the directions leftby the divine Mantuan in his will to be carried into effect. So that,Senor Ambrosio while you consign your friend's body to the earth, youshould not consign his writings to oblivion, for if he gave the orderin bitterness of heart, it is not right that you should irrationallyobey it. On the contrary, by granting life to those papers, let thecruelty of Marcela live for ever, to serve as a warning in ages to cometo all men to shun and avoid falling into like danger; or I and all ofus who have come here know already the story of this your love-strickenand heart-broken friend, and we know, too, your friendship, and thecause of his death, and the directions he gave at the close of hislife; from which sad story may be gathered how great was the cruelty ofMarcela, the love of Chrysostom, and the loyalty of your friendship,together with the end awaiting those who pursue rashly the path thatinsane passion opens to their eyes. Last night we learned the death ofChrysostom and that he was to be buried here, and out of curiosity andpity we left our direct road and resolved to come and see with our eyesthat which when heard of had so moved our compassion, and inconsideration of that compassion and our desire to prove it if we mightby condolence, we beg of you, excellent Ambrosio, or at least I on myown account entreat you, that instead of burning those papers you allowme to carry away some of them."And without waiting for the shepherd's answer, he stretched out hishand and took up some of those that were nearest to him; seeing whichAmbrosio said, "Out of courtesy, senor, I will grant your request as tothose you have taken, but it is idle to expect me to abstain fromburning the remainder."Vivaldo, who was eager to see what the papers contained, opened one ofthem at once, and saw that its title was "Lay of Despair."Ambrosio hearing it said, "That is the last paper the unhappy manwrote; and that you may see, senor, to what an end his misfortunesbrought him, read it so that you may be heard, for you will have timeenough for that while we are waiting for the grave to be dug.""I will do so very willingly," said Vivaldo; and as all the bystanderswere equally eager they gathered round him, and he, reading in a loudvoice, found that it ran as follows.c13e.jpg (15K)CHAPTER XIV.WHEREIN ARE INSERTED THE DESPAIRING VERSES OF THE DEAD SHEPHERD,TOGETHER WITH OTHER INCIDENTS NOT LOOKED FORc14a.jpg (172K)Full SizeTHE LAY OF CHRYSOSTOMSince thou dost in thy cruelty desireThe ruthless rigour of thy tyrannyFrom tongue to tongue, from land to land proclaimed,The very Hell will I constrain to lendThis stricken breast of mine deep notes of woeTo serve my need of fitting utterance.And as I strive to body forth the taleOf all I suffer, all that thou hast done,Forth shall the dread voice roll, and bear alongShreds from my vitals torn for greater pain.Then listen, not to dulcet harmony,But to a discord wrung by mad despairOut of this bosom's depths of bitterness,To ease my heart and plant a sting in thine.The lion's roar, the fierce wolf's savage howl,The horrid hissing of the scaly snake,The awesome cries of monsters yet unnamed,The crow's ill-boding croak, the hollow moanOf wild winds wrestling with the restless sea,The wrathful bellow of the vanquished bull,The plaintive sobbing of the widowed dove,The envied owl's sad note, the wail of woeThat rises from the dreary choir of Hell,Commingled in one sound, confusing sense,Let all these come to aid my soul's complaint,For pain like mine demands new modes of song.No echoes of that discord shall be heardWhere Father Tagus rolls, or on the banksOf olive-bordered Betis; to the rocksOr in deep caverns shall my plaint be told,And by a lifeless tongue in living words;Or in dark valleys or on lonely shores,Where neither foot of man nor sunbeam falls;Or in among the poison-breathing swarmsOf monsters nourished by the sluggish Nile.For, though it be to solitudes remoteThe hoarse vague echoes of my sorrows soundThy matchless cruelty, my dismal fateShall carry them to all the spacious world.Disdain hath power to kill, and patience diesSlain by suspicion, be it false or true;And deadly is the force of jealousy;Long absence makes of life a dreary void;No hope of happiness can give reposeTo him that ever fears to be forgot;And death, inevitable, waits in hall.But I, by some strange miracle, live onA prey to absence, jealousy, disdain;Racked by suspicion as by certainty;Forgotten, left to feed my flame alone.And while I suffer thus, there comes no rayOf hope to gladden me athwart the gloom;Nor do I look for it in my despair;But rather clinging to a cureless woe,All hope do I abjure for evermore.Can there be hope where fear is? Were it well,When far more certain are the grounds of fear?Ought I to shut mine eyes to jealousy,If through a thousand heart-wounds it appears?Who would not give free access to distrust,Seeing disdain unveiled, and--bitter change!--All his suspicions turned to certainties,And the fair truth transformed into a lie?Oh, thou fierce tyrant of the realms of love,Oh, Jealousy! put chains upon these hands,And bind me with thy strongest cord, Disdain.But, woe is me! triumphant over all,My sufferings drown the memory of you.And now I die, and since there is no hopeOf happiness for me in life or death,Still to my fantasy I'll fondly cling.I'll say that he is wise who loveth well,And that the soul most free is that most boundIn thraldom to the ancient tyrant Love.I'll say that she who is mine enemyIn that fair body hath as fair a mind,And that her coldness is but my desert,And that by virtue of the pain he sendsLove rules his kingdom with a gentle sway.Thus, self-deluding, and in bondage sore,And wearing out the wretched shred of lifeTo which I am reduced by her disdain,I'll give this soul and body to the winds,All hopeless of a crown of bliss in store.Thou whose injustice hath supplied the causeThat makes me quit the weary life I loathe,As by this wounded bosom thou canst seeHow willingly thy victim I become,Let not my death, if haply worth a tear,Cloud the clear heaven that dwells in thy bright eyes;I would not have thee expiate in aughtThe crime of having made my heart thy prey;But rather let thy laughter gaily ringAnd prove my death to be thy festival.Fool that I am to bid thee! well I knowThy glory gains by my untimely end.And now it is the time; from Hell's abyssCome thirsting Tantalus, come SisyphusHeaving the cruel stone, come TityusWith vulture, and with wheel Ixion come,And come the sisters of the ceaseless toil;And all into this breast transfer their pains,And (if such tribute to despair be due)Chant in their deepest tones a doleful dirgeOver a corse unworthy of a shroud.Let the three-headed guardian of the gate,And all the monstrous progeny of hell,The doleful concert join: a lover deadMethinks can have no fitter obsequies.Lay of despair, grieve not when thou art goneForth from this sorrowing heart: my miseryBrings fortune to the cause that gave thee birth;Then banish sadness even in the tomb.The "Lay of Chrysostom" met with the approbation of the listeners,though the reader said it did not seem to him to agree with what he hadheard of Marcela's reserve and propriety, for Chrysostom complained init of jealousy, suspicion, and absence, all to the prejudice of thegood name and fame of Marcela; to which Ambrosio replied as one whoknew well his friend's most secret thoughts, "Senor, to remove thatdoubt I should tell you that when the unhappy man wrote this lay he wasaway from Marcela, from whom he had voluntarily separated himself, totry if absence would act with him as it is wont; and as everythingdistresses and every fear haunts the banished lover, so imaginaryjealousies and suspicions, dreaded as if they were true, tormentedChrysostom; and thus the truth of what report declares of the virtue ofMarcela remains unshaken, and with her envy itself should not andcannot find any fault save that of being cruel, somewhat haughty, andvery scornful.""That is true," said Vivaldo; and as he was about to read another paperof those he had preserved from the fire, he was stopped by a marvellousvision (for such it seemed) that unexpectedly presented itself to theireyes; for on the summit of the rock where they were digging the gravethere appeared the shepherdess Marcela, so beautiful that her beautyexceeded its reputation. Those who had never till then beheld her gazedupon her in wonder and silence, and those who were accustomed to seeher were not less amazed than those who had never seen her before. Butthe instant Ambrosio saw her he addressed her, with manifestindignation:"Art thou come, by chance, cruel basilisk of these mountains, to see ifin thy presence blood will flow from the wounds of this wretched beingthy cruelty has robbed of life; or is it to exult over the cruel workof thy humours that thou art come; or like another pitiless Nero tolook down from that height upon the ruin of his Rome in embers; or inthy arrogance to trample on this ill-fated corpse, as the ungratefuldaughter trampled on her father Tarquin's? Tell us quickly for whatthou art come, or what it is thou wouldst have, for, as I know thethoughts of Chrysostom never failed to obey thee in life, I will makeall these who call themselves his friends obey thee, though he bedead.""I come not, Ambrosio for any of the purposes thou hast named," repliedMarcela, "but to defend myself and to prove how unreasonable are allthose who blame me for their sorrow and for Chrysostom's death; andtherefore I ask all of you that are here to give me your attention, forit will not take much time or many words to bring the truth home topersons of sense. Heaven has made me, so you say, beautiful, and somuch so that in spite of yourselves my beauty leads you to love me; andfor the love you show me you say, and even urge, that I am bound tolove you. By that natural understanding which God has given me I knowthat everything beautiful attracts love, but I cannot see how, byreason of being loved, that which is loved for its beauty is bound tolove that which loves it; besides, it may happen that the lover of thatwhich is beautiful may be ugly, and ugliness being detestable, it isvery absurd to say, "I love thee because thou art beautiful, thou mustlove me though I be ugly." But supposing the beauty equal on bothsides, it does not follow that the inclinations must be thereforealike, for it is not every beauty that excites love, some but pleasingthe eye without winning the affection; and if every sort of beautyexcited love and won the heart, the will would wander vaguely to andfro unable to make choice of any; for as there is an infinity ofbeautiful objects there must be an infinity of inclinations, and truelove, I have heard it said, is indivisible, and must be voluntary andnot compelled. If this be so, as I believe it to be, why do you desireme to bend my will by force, for no other reason but that you say youlove me? Nay--tell me--had Heaven made me ugly, as it has made mebeautiful, could I with justice complain of you for not loving me?Moreover, you must remember that the beauty I possess was no choice ofmine, for, be it what it may, Heaven of its bounty gave it me withoutmy asking or choosing it; and as the viper, though it kills with it,does not deserve to be blamed for the poison it carries, as it is agift of nature, neither do I deserve reproach for being beautiful; forbeauty in a modest woman is like fire at a distance or a sharp sword;the one does not burn, the other does not cut, those who do not cometoo near. Honour and virtue are the ornaments of the mind, withoutwhich the body, though it be so, has no right to pass for beautiful;but if modesty is one of the virtues that specially lend a grace andcharm to mind and body, why should she who is loved for her beauty partwith it to gratify one who for his pleasure alone strives with all hismight and energy to rob her of it? I was born free, and that I mightlive in freedom I chose the solitude of the fields; in the trees of themountains I find society, the clear waters of the brooks are mymirrors, and to the trees and waters I make known my thoughts andcharms. I am a fire afar off, a sword laid aside. Those whom I haveinspired with love by letting them see me, I have by words undeceived,and if their longings live on hope--and I have given none to Chrysostomor to any other--it cannot justly be said that the death of any is mydoing, for it was rather his own obstinacy than my cruelty that killedhim; and if it be made a charge against me that his wishes werehonourable, and that therefore I was bound to yield to them, I answerthat when on this very spot where now his grave is made he declared tome his purity of purpose, I told him that mine was to live in perpetualsolitude, and that the earth alone should enjoy the fruits of myretirement and the spoils of my beauty; and if, after this open avowal,he chose to persist against hope and steer against the wind, whatwonder is it that he should sink in the depths of his infatuation? If Ihad encouraged him, I should be false; if I had gratified him, I shouldhave acted against my own better resolution and purpose. He waspersistent in spite of warning, he despaired without being hated.Bethink you now if it be reasonable that his suffering should be laidto my charge. Let him who has been deceived complain, let him give wayto despair whose encouraged hopes have proved vain, let him flatterhimself whom I shall entice, let him boast whom I shall receive; butlet not him call me cruel or homicide to whom I make no promise, uponwhom I practise no deception, whom I neither entice nor receive. It hasnot been so far the will of Heaven that I should love by fate, and toexpect me to love by choice is idle. Let this general declaration servefor each of my suitors on his own account, and let it be understoodfrom this time forth that if anyone dies for me it is not of jealousyor misery he dies, for she who loves no one can give no cause forjealousy to any, and candour is not to be confounded with scorn. Lethim who calls me wild beast and basilisk, leave me alone as somethingnoxious and evil; let him who calls me ungrateful, withhold hisservice; who calls me wayward, seek not my acquaintance; who calls mecruel, pursue me not; for this wild beast, this basilisk, thisungrateful, cruel, wayward being has no kind of desire to seek, serve,know, or follow them. If Chrysostom's impatience and violent passionkilled him, why should my modest behaviour and circumspection beblamed? If I preserve my purity in the society of the trees, why shouldhe who would have me preserve it among men, seek to rob me of it? Ihave, as you know, wealth of my own, and I covet not that of others; mytaste is for freedom, and I have no relish for constraint; I neitherlove nor hate anyone; I do not deceive this one or court that, ortrifle with one or play with another. The modest converse of theshepherd girls of these hamlets and the care of my goats are myrecreations; my desires are bounded by these mountains, and if theyever wander hence it is to contemplate the beauty of the heavens, stepsby which the soul travels to its primeval abode."With these words, and not waiting to hear a reply, she turned andpassed into the thickest part of a wood that was hard by, leaving allwho were there lost in admiration as much of her good sense as of herbeauty. Some--those wounded by the irresistible shafts launched by herbright eyes--made as though they would follow her, heedless of the frankdeclaration they had heard; seeing which, and deeming this a fittingoccasion for the exercise of his chivalry in aid of distressed damsels,Don Quixote, laying his hand on the hilt of his sword, exclaimed in aloud and distinct voice:"Let no one, whatever his rank or condition, dare to follow thebeautiful Marcela, under pain of incurring my fierce indignation. Shehas shown by clear and satisfactory arguments that little or no faultis to be found with her for the death of Chrysostom, and also how farshe is from yielding to the wishes of any of her lovers, for whichreason, instead of being followed and persecuted, she should in justicebe honoured and esteemed by all the good people of the world, for sheshows that she is the only woman in it that holds to such a virtuousresolution."Whether it was because of the threats of Don Quixote, or becauseAmbrosio told them to fulfil their duty to their good friend, none ofthe shepherds moved or stirred from the spot until, having finished thegrave and burned Chrysostom's papers, they laid his body in it, notwithout many tears from those who stood by. They closed the grave witha heavy stone until a slab was ready which Ambrosio said he meant tohave prepared, with an epitaph which was to be to this effect:Beneath the stone before your eyesThe body of a lover lies;In life he was a shepherd swain,In death a victim to disdain.Ungrateful, cruel, coy, and fair,Was she that drove him to despair,And Love hath made her his allyFor spreading wide his tyranny.They then strewed upon the grave a profusion of flowers and branches,and all expressing their condolence with his friend Ambrosio, tooktheir leave. Vivaldo and his companion did the same; and Don Quixotebade farewell to his hosts and to the travellers, who pressed him tocome with them to Seville, as being such a convenient place for findingadventures, for they presented themselves in every street and roundevery corner oftener than anywhere else. Don Quixote thanked them fortheir advice and for the disposition they showed to do him a favour,and said that for the present he would not, and must not go to Sevilleuntil he had cleared all these mountains of highwaymen and robbers, ofwhom report said they were full. Seeing his good intention, thetravellers were unwilling to press him further, and once more biddinghim farewell, they left him and pursued their journey, in the course ofwhich they did not fail to discuss the story of Marcela and Chrysostomas well as the madness of Don Quixote. He, on his part, resolved to goin quest of the shepherdess Marcela, and make offer to her of all theservice he could render her; but things did not fall out with him as heexpected, according to what is related in the course of this veracioushistory, of which the Second Part ends here.c14e.jpg (31K)CHAPTER XV.IN WHICH IS RELATED THE UNFORTUNATE ADVENTURE THAT DON QUIXOTE FELL INWITH WHEN HE FELL OUT WITH CERTAIN HEARTLESS YANGUESANSc15a.jpg (81K)Full SizeThe sage Cid Hamete Benengeli relates that as soon as Don Quixote tookleave of his hosts and all who had been present at the burial ofChrysostom, he and his squire passed into the same wood which they hadseen the shepherdess Marcela enter, and after having wandered for morethan two hours in all directions in search of her without finding her,they came to a halt in a glade covered with tender grass, beside whichran a pleasant cool stream that invited and compelled them to passthere the hours of the noontide heat, which by this time was beginningto come on oppressively. Don Quixote and Sancho dismounted, and turningRocinante and the ass loose to feed on the grass that was there inabundance, they ransacked the alforjas, and without any ceremony verypeacefully and sociably master and man made their repast on what theyfound in them.c15b.jpg (376K)Full SizeSancho had not thought it worth while to hobble Rocinante, feelingsure, from what he knew of his staidness and freedom from incontinence,that all the mares in the Cordova pastures would not lead him into animpropriety. Chance, however, and the devil, who is not always asleep,so ordained it that feeding in this valley there was a drove ofGalician ponies belonging to certain Yanguesan carriers, whose way itis to take their midday rest with their teams in places and spots wheregrass and water abound; and that where Don Quixote chanced to be suitedthe Yanguesans' purpose very well. It so happened, then, that Rocinantetook a fancy to disport himself with their ladyships the ponies, andabandoning his usual gait and demeanour as he scented them, he, withoutasking leave of his master, got up a briskish little trot and hastenedto make known his wishes to them; they, however, it seemed, preferredtheir pasture to him, and received him with their heels and teeth tosuch effect that they soon broke his girths and left him naked withouta saddle to cover him; but what must have been worse to him was thatthe carriers, seeing the violence he was offering to their mares, camerunning up armed with stakes, and so belaboured him that they broughthim sorely battered to the ground.By this time Don Quixote and Sancho, who had witnessed the drubbing ofRocinante, came up panting, and said Don Quixote to Sancho:"So far as I can see, friend Sancho, these are not knights but basefolk of low birth: I mention it because thou canst lawfully aid me intaking due vengeance for the insult offered to Rocinante before oureyes.""What the devil vengeance can we take," answered Sancho, "if they aremore than twenty, and we no more than two, or, indeed, perhaps not morethan one and a half?""I count for a hundred," replied Don Quixote, and without more words hedrew his sword and attacked the Yanguesans and excited and impelled bythe example of his master, Sancho did the same; and to begin with, DonQuixote delivered a slash at one of them that laid open the leatherjerkin he wore, together with a great portion of his shoulder. TheYanguesans, seeing themselves assaulted by only two men while they wereso many, betook themselves to their stakes, and driving the two intothe middle they began to lay on with great zeal and energy; in fact, atthe second blow they brought Sancho to the ground, and Don Quixotefared the same way, all his skill and high mettle availing him nothing,and fate willed it that he should fall at the feet of Rocinante, whohad not yet risen; whereby it may be seen how furiously stakes canpound in angry boorish hands.c15c.jpg (362K)Full SizeThen, seeing the mischief they had done, the Yanguesans with all thehaste they could loaded their team and pursued their journey, leavingthe two adventurers a sorry sight and in sorrier mood.Sancho was the first to come to, and finding himself close to hismaster he called to him in a weak and doleful voice, "Senor DonQuixote, ah, Senor Don Quixote!""What wouldst thou, brother Sancho?" answered Don Quixote in the samefeeble suffering tone as Sancho."I would like, if it were possible," answered Sancho Panza, "yourworship to give me a couple of sups of that potion of the fiery Blas,if it be that you have any to hand there; perhaps it will serve forbroken bones as well as for wounds.""If I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?"said Don Quixote; "but I swear to thee, Sancho Panza, on the faith of aknight-errant, ere two days are over, unless fortune orders otherwise,I mean to have it in my possession, or my hand will have lost itscunning.""But in how many does your worship think we shall have the use of ourfeet?" answered Sancho Panza."For myself I must say I cannot guess how many," said the batteredknight Don Quixote; "but I take all the blame upon myself, for I had nobusiness to put hand to sword against men who where not dubbed knightslike myself, and so I believe that in punishment for havingtransgressed the laws of chivalry the God of battles has permitted thischastisement to be administered to me; for which reason, brotherSancho, it is well thou shouldst receive a hint on the matter which Iam now about to mention to thee, for it is of much importance to thewelfare of both of us. It is that when thou shalt see rabble of thissort offering us insult thou art not to wait till I draw sword againstthem, for I shall not do so at all; but do thou draw sword and chastisethem to thy heart's content, and if any knights come to their aid anddefence I will take care to defend thee and assail them with all mymight; and thou hast already seen by a thousand signs and proofs whatthe might of this strong arm of mine is equal to"--so uplifted had thepoor gentleman become through the victory over the stout Biscayan.But Sancho did not so fully approve of his master's admonition as tolet it pass without saying in reply, "Senor, I am a man of peace, meekand quiet, and I can put up with any affront because I have a wife andchildren to support and bring up; so let it be likewise a hint to yourworship, as it cannot be a mandate, that on no account will I drawsword either against clown or against knight, and that here before GodI forgive the insults that have been offered me, whether they havebeen, are, or shall be offered me by high or low, rich or poor, nobleor commoner, not excepting any rank or condition whatsoever."To all which his master said in reply, "I wish I had breath enough tospeak somewhat easily, and that the pain I feel on this side wouldabate so as to let me explain to thee, Panza, the mistake thou makest.Come now, sinner, suppose the wind of fortune, hitherto so adverse,should turn in our favour, filling the sails of our desires so thatsafely and without impediment we put into port in some one of thoseislands I have promised thee, how would it be with thee if on winningit I made thee lord of it? Why, thou wilt make it well-nigh impossiblethrough not being a knight nor having any desire to be one, norpossessing the courage nor the will to avenge insults or defend thylordship; for thou must know that in newly conquered kingdoms andprovinces the minds of the inhabitants are never so quiet nor so welldisposed to the new lord that there is no fear of their making somemove to change matters once more, and try, as they say, what chance maydo for them; so it is essential that the new possessor should have goodsense to enable him to govern, and valour to attack and defend himself,whatever may befall him.""In what has now befallen us," answered Sancho, "I'd have been wellpleased to have that good sense and that valour your worship speaks of,but I swear on the faith of a poor man I am more fit for plasters thanfor arguments. See if your worship can get up, and let us helpRocinante, though he does not deserve it, for he was the main cause ofall this thrashing. I never thought it of Rocinante, for I took him tobe a virtuous person and as quiet as myself. After all, they say rightthat it takes a long time to come to know people, and that there isnothing sure in this life. Who would have said that, after such mightyslashes as your worship gave that unlucky knight-errant, there wascoming, travelling post and at the very heels of them, such a greatstorm of sticks as has fallen upon our shoulders?""And yet thine, Sancho," replied Don Quixote, "ought to be used to suchsqualls; but mine, reared in soft cloth and fine linen, it is plainthey must feel more keenly the pain of this mishap, and if it were notthat I imagine--why do I say imagine?--know of a certainty that all theseannoyances are very necessary accompaniments of the calling of arms, Iwould lay me down here to die of pure vexation."To this the squire replied, "Senor, as these mishaps are what one reapsof chivalry, tell me if they happen very often, or if they have theirown fixed times for coming to pass; because it seems to me that aftertwo harvests we shall be no good for the third, unless God in hisinfinite mercy helps us.""Know, friend Sancho," answered Don Quixote, "that the life ofknights-errant is subject to a thousand dangers and reverses, andneither more nor less is it within immediate possibility forknights-errant to become kings and emperors, as experience has shown inthe case of many different knights with whose histories I am thoroughlyacquainted; and I could tell thee now, if the pain would let me, ofsome who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I havementioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced diversmisfortunes and miseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himselfin the power of his mortal enemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it ispositively asserted, holding him captive, gave him more than twohundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied to one of thepillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author ofno small authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught ina certain pitfall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, onfalling found himself bound hand and foot in a deep pit underground,where they administered to him one of those things they call clysters,of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh finished him; and if he had notbeen succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, a great friend of his,it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I may well sufferin company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would havethee know, Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happenby chance to be in hand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down inthe law of the duel in express words: if, for instance, the cobblerstrikes another with the last which he has in his hand, though it be infact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason that he whom hestruck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldstimagine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we havetherefore suffered any indignity; for the arms those men carried, withwhich they pounded us, were nothing more than their stakes, and not oneof them, so far as I remember, carried rapier, sword, or dagger.""They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardlyhad I laid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulderswith their sticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyesand the strength out of my feet, stretching me where I now lie, andwhere thinking of whether all those stake-strokes were an indignity ornot gives me no uneasiness, which the pain of the blows does, for theywill remain as deeply impressed on my memory as on my shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "thatthere is no recollection which time does not put an end to, and no painwhich death does not remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than theone that waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? Ifour mishap were one of those that are cured with a couple of plasters,it would not be so bad; but I am beginning to think that all theplasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to put us right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean todo," returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for itseems to me that not the least share of this mishap has fallen to thelot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is aknight-errant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have comeoff scot-free where we come out scotched.""Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bringrelief to it," said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beastmay now supply the want of Rocinante, carrying me hence to some castlewhere I may be cured of my wounds. And moreover I shall not hold it anydishonour to be so mounted, for I remember having read how the good oldSilenus, the tutor and instructor of the gay god of laughter, when heentered the city of the hundred gates, went very contentedly mounted ona handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answeredSancho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted andgoing slung like a sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honourinstead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as Itold thee before, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thybeast in whatever fashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence erenight come on and surprise us in these wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it isvery meet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and thatthey esteem it very good fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when theyare in love; and so true is this that there have been knights who haveremained two years on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all theinclemencies of heaven, without their ladies knowing anything of it;and one of these was Amadis, when, under the name of Beltenebros, hetook up his abode on the Pena Pobre for--I know not if it was eightyears or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; at anyrate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique thePrincess Oriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, andmake haste before a mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and lettingoff thirty "ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twentymaledictions and execrations on whomsoever it was that had brought himthere, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bowwithout power to bring himself upright, but with all his pains hesaddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as forhim, had he possessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neitherSancho nor his master would have been behind him.c15d.jpg (329K)Full SizeTo be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on the ass and secured Rocinantewith a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, he proceededmore or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them fromgood to better, he had not gone a short league when the road came insight, and on it he perceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to thedelight of Don Quixote must needs be a castle. Sancho insisted that itwas an inn, and his master that it was not one, but a castle, and thedispute lasted so long that before the point was settled they had timeto reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.c15e.jpg (31K)CHAPTER XVI.OF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TOBE A CASTLEc16a.jpg (129K)Full SizeThe innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sanchowhat was amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only thathe had fallen down from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. Theinnkeeper had a wife whose disposition was not such as those of hercalling commonly have, for she was by nature kind-hearted and felt forthe sufferings of her neighbours, so she at once set about tending DonQuixote, and made her young daughter, a very comely girl, help her intaking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, as servant, anAsturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to besure, made up for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms fromhead to foot, and her shoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, madeher contemplate the ground more than she liked. This graceful lass,then, helped the young girl, and the two made up a very bad bed for DonQuixote in a garret that showed evident signs of having formerly servedfor many years as a straw-loft, in which there was also quartered acarrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had muchthe advantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four roughboards on two not very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinnessmight have passed for a quilt, full of pellets which, were they notseen through the rents to be wool, would to the touch have seemedpebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and a coverletthe threads of which anyone that chose might have counted withoutmissing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess andher daughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, whileMaritornes--for that was the name of the Asturian--held the light forthem, and while plastering him, the hostess, observing how full ofwheals Don Quixote was in some places, remarked that this had more thelook of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points andprojections, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora,"he added, "manage to save some tow, as there will be no want of someoneto use it, for my loins too are rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got atseeing my master fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had athousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a timehappened to me to dream that I was falling down from a tower and nevercoming to the ground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself asweak and shaken as if I had really fallen.""There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I withoutdreaming at all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself withscarcely less wheals than my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is aknight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seenin the world this long time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thingthat in two words is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the mostmiserable and needy being in the world, and to-morrow will have two orthree crowns of kingdoms to give his squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a masteras this, you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as acounty?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a monthgoing in quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing thatcan be called one, for it will happen that when one thing is looked foranother thing is found; however, if my master Don Quixote gets well ofthis wound, or fall, and I am left none the worse of it, I would notchange my hopes for the best title in Spain."To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively,and sitting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess bythe hand he said to her, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourselffortunate in having in this castle of yours sheltered my person, whichis such that if I do not myself praise it, it is because of what iscommonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will inform youwho I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed onmy memory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you mygratitude while life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held menot so enthralled and subject to its laws and to the eyes of that fairingrate whom I name between my teeth, but that those of this lovelydamsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened inbewilderment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understoodabout as much of them as if he had been talking Greek, though theycould perceive they were all meant for expressions of good-will andblandishments; and not being accustomed to this kind of language, theystared at him and wondered to themselves, for he seemed to them a manof a different sort from those they were used to, and thanking him inpothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night,and she had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and thefamily asleep she would come in search of him and meet his wishesunreservedly. And it is said of this good lass that she never madepromises of the kind without fulfilling them, even though she made themin a forest and without any witness present, for she plumed herselfgreatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such anemployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes andill-luck had brought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched,rickety bed of Don Quixote stood first in the middle of this star-litstable, and close beside it Sancho made his, which merely consisted ofa rush mat and a blanket that looked as if it was of threadbare canvasrather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that of the carrier,made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek,plump, and in prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers ofArevalo, according to the author of this history, who particularlymentions this carrier because he knew him very well, and they even saywas in some degree a relation of his; besides which Cid HameteBenengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in all things,as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those thathave been already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant theymight be, an example that might be followed by those grave historianswho relate transactions so curtly and briefly that we hardly get ataste of them, all the substance of the work being left in the inkstandfrom carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thousand blessings onthe author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the other book inwhich the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with whatminuteness they describe everything!To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given themtheir second feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddlesand lay waiting for his conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by thistime plastered and had lain down, and though he strove to sleep thepain of his ribs would not let him, while Don Quixote with the pain ofhis had his eyes as wide open as a hare's.c16b.jpg (333K)Full SizeThe inn was all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no lightexcept that given by a lantern that hung burning in the middle of thegateway. This strange stillness, and the thoughts, always present toour knight's mind, of the incidents described at every turn in thebooks that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, whichwas that he fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, ashas been said, all the inns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), andthat the daughter of the innkeeper was daughter of the lord of thecastle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing, had fallen in lovewith him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while that nightwithout the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy thathe had constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and toconsider the perilous risk which his virtue was about to encounter, andhe resolved in his heart to commit no treason to his lady Dulcinea delToboso, even though the queen Guinevere herself and the dame Quintanonashould present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and thehour--an unlucky one for him--arrived for the Asturian to come, who inher smock, with bare feet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif,with noiseless and cautious steps entered the chamber where the threewere quartered, in quest of the carrier; but scarcely had she gainedthe door when Don Quixote perceived her, and sitting up in his bed inspite of his plasters and the pain of his ribs, he stretched out hisarms to receive his beauteous damsel. The Asturian, who went alldoubled up and in silence with her hands before her feeling for herlover, encountered the arms of Don Quixote, who grasped her tightly bythe wrist, and drawing her towards him, while she dared not utter aword, made her sit down on the bed. He then felt her smock, andalthough it was of sackcloth it appeared to him to be of the finest andsoftest silk: on her wrists she wore some glass beads, but to him theyhad the sheen of precious Orient pearls: her hair, which in somemeasure resembled a horse's mane, he rated as threads of the brightestgold of Araby, whose refulgence dimmed the sun himself: her breath,which no doubt smelt of yesterday's stale salad, seemed to him todiffuse a sweet aromatic fragrance from her mouth; and, in short, hedrew her portrait in his imagination with the same features and in thesame style as that which he had seen in his books of the otherprincesses who, smitten by love, came with all the adornments that arehere set down, to see the sorely wounded knight; and so great was thepoor gentleman's blindness that neither touch, nor smell, nor anythingelse about the good lass that would have made any but a carrier vomit,were enough to undeceive him; on the contrary, he was persuaded he hadthe goddess of beauty in his arms, and holding her firmly in his grasphe went on to say in low, tender voice:"Would that I found myself, lovely and exalted lady, in a position torepay such a favour as that which you, by the sight of your greatbeauty, have granted me; but fortune, which is never weary ofpersecuting the good, has chosen to place me upon this bed, where I lieso bruised and broken that though my inclination would gladly complywith yours it is impossible; besides, to this impossibility another yetgreater is to be added, which is the faith that I have pledged to thepeerless Dulcinea del Toboso, sole lady of my most secret thoughts; andwere it not that this stood in the way I should not be so insensible aknight as to miss the happy opportunity which your great goodness hasoffered me."Maritornes was fretting and sweating at finding herself held so fast byDon Quixote, and not understanding or heeding the words he addressed toher, she strove without speaking to free herself. The worthy carrier,whose unholy thoughts kept him awake, was aware of his doxy the momentshe entered the door, and was listening attentively to all Don Quixotesaid; and jealous that the Asturian should have broken her word withhim for another, drew nearer to Don Quixote's bed and stood still tosee what would come of this talk which he could not understand; butwhen he perceived the wench struggling to get free and Don Quixotestriving to hold her, not relishing the joke he raised his arm anddelivered such a terrible cuff on the lank jaws of the amorous knightthat he bathed all his mouth in blood, and not content with this hemounted on his ribs and with his feet tramped all over them at a pacerather smarter than a trot. The bed which was somewhat crazy and notvery firm on its feet, unable to support the additional weight of thecarrier, came to the ground, and at the mighty crash of this theinnkeeper awoke and at once concluded that it must be some brawl ofMaritornes', because after calling loudly to her he got no answer. Withthis suspicion he got up, and lighting a lamp hastened to the quarterwhere he had heard the disturbance. The wench, seeing that her masterwas coming and knowing that his temper was terrible, frightened andpanic-stricken made for the bed of Sancho Panza, who still slept, andcrouching upon it made a ball of herself.The innkeeper came in exclaiming, "Where art thou, strumpet? Of coursethis is some of thy work." At this Sancho awoke, and feeling this massalmost on top of him fancied he had the nightmare and began todistribute fisticuffs all round, of which a certain share fell uponMaritornes, who, irritated by the pain and flinging modesty aside, paidback so many in return to Sancho that she woke him up in spite ofhimself. He then, finding himself so handled, by whom he knew not,raising himself up as well as he could, grappled with Maritornes, andhe and she between them began the bitterest and drollest scrimmage inthe world. The carrier, however, perceiving by the light of theinnkeeper candle how it fared with his ladylove, quitting Don Quixote,ran to bring her the help she needed; and the innkeeper did the samebut with a different intention, for his was to chastise the lass, as hebelieved that beyond a doubt she alone was the cause of all theharmony. And so, as the saying is, cat to rat, rat to rope, rope tostick, the carrier pounded Sancho, Sancho the lass, she him, and theinnkeeper her, and all worked away so briskly that they did not givethemselves a moment's rest; and the best of it was that the innkeeper'slamp went out, and as they were left in the dark they all laid on oneupon the other in a mass so unmercifully that there was not a soundspot left where a hand could light.It so happened that there was lodging that night in the inn acaudrillero of what they call the Old Holy Brotherhood of Toledo, who,also hearing the extraordinary noise of the conflict, seized his staffand the tin case with his warrants, and made his way in the dark intothe room crying: "Hold! in the name of the Jurisdiction! Hold! in thename of the Holy Brotherhood!"The first that he came upon was the pummelled Don Quixote, who laystretched senseless on his back upon his broken-down bed, and, his handfalling on the beard as he felt about, he continued to cry, "Help forthe Jurisdiction!" but perceiving that he whom he had laid hold of didnot move or stir, he concluded that he was dead and that those in theroom were his murderers, and with this suspicion he raised his voicestill higher, calling out, "Shut the inn gate; see that no one goesout; they have killed a man here!" This cry startled them all, and eachdropped the contest at the point at which the voice reached him. Theinnkeeper retreated to his room, the carrier to his pack-saddles, thelass to her crib; the unlucky Don Quixote and Sancho alone were unableto move from where they were. The cuadrillero on this let go DonQuixote's beard, and went out to look for a light to search for andapprehend the culprits; but not finding one, as the innkeeper hadpurposely extinguished the lantern on retreating to his room, he wascompelled to have recourse to the hearth, where after much time andtrouble he lit another lamp.c16e.jpg (32K)CHAPTER XVII.IN WHICH ARE CONTAINED THE INNUMERABLE TROUBLES WHICH THE BRAVE DONQUIXOTE AND HIS GOOD SQUIRE SANCHO PANZA ENDURED IN THE INN, WHICH TOHIS MISFORTUNE HE TOOK TO BE A CASTLEc17a.jpg (87K)Full SizeBy this time Don Quixote had recovered from his swoon; and in the sametone of voice in which he had called to his squire the day before whenhe lay stretched "in the vale of the stakes," he began calling to himnow, "Sancho, my friend, art thou asleep? sleepest thou, friendSancho?""How can I sleep, curses on it!" returned Sancho discontentedly andbitterly, "when it is plain that all the devils have been at me thisnight?""Thou mayest well believe that," answered Don Quixote, "because, eitherI know little, or this castle is enchanted, for thou must know--but thisthat I am now about to tell thee thou must swear to keep secret untilafter my death.""I swear it," answered Sancho."I say so," continued Don Quixote, "because I hate taking away anyone'sgood name.""I say," replied Sancho, "that I swear to hold my tongue about it tillthe end of your worship's days, and God grant I may be able to let itout to-morrow.""Do I do thee such injuries, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "that thouwouldst see me dead so soon?""It is not for that," replied Sancho, "but because I hate keepingthings long, and I don't want them to grow rotten with me fromover-keeping.""At any rate," said Don Quixote, "I have more confidence in thyaffection and good nature; and so I would have thee know that thisnight there befell me one of the strangest adventures that I coulddescribe, and to relate it to thee briefly thou must know that a littlewhile ago the daughter of the lord of this castle came to me, and thatshe is the most elegant and beautiful damsel that could be found in thewide world. What I could tell thee of the charms of her person! of herlively wit! of other secret matters which, to preserve the fealty I oweto my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, I shall pass over unnoticed and insilence! I will only tell thee that, either fate being envious of sogreat a boon placed in my hands by good fortune, or perhaps (and thisis more probable) this castle being, as I have already said, enchanted,at the time when I was engaged in the sweetest and most amorousdiscourse with her, there came, without my seeing or knowing whence itcame, a hand attached to some arm of some huge giant, that planted sucha cuff on my jaws that I have them all bathed in blood, and thenpummelled me in such a way that I am in a worse plight than yesterdaywhen the carriers, on account of Rocinante's misbehaviour, inflicted onus the injury thou knowest of; whence conjecture that there must besome enchanted Moor guarding the treasure of this damsel's beauty, andthat it is not for me.""Not for me either," said Sancho, "for more than four hundred Moorshave so thrashed me that the drubbing of the stakes was cakes andfancy-bread to it. But tell me, senor, what do you call this excellentand rare adventure that has left us as we are left now? Though yourworship was not so badly off, having in your arms that incomparablebeauty you spoke of; but I, what did I have, except the heaviest whacksI think I had in all my life? Unlucky me and the mother that bore me!for I am not a knight-errant and never expect to be one, and of all themishaps, the greater part falls to my share.""Then thou hast been thrashed too?" said Don Quixote."Didn't I say so? worse luck to my line!" said Sancho."Be not distressed, friend," said Don Quixote, "for I will now make theprecious balsam with which we shall cure ourselves in the twinkling ofan eye."By this time the cuadrillero had succeeded in lighting the lamp, andcame in to see the man that he thought had been killed; and as Sanchocaught sight of him at the door, seeing him coming in his shirt, with acloth on his head, and a lamp in his hand, and a very forbiddingcountenance, he said to his master, "Senor, can it be that this is theenchanted Moor coming back to give us more castigation if there beanything still left in the ink-bottle?""It cannot be the Moor," answered Don Quixote, "for those underenchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone.""If they don't let themselves be seen, they let themselves be felt,"said Sancho; "if not, let my shoulders speak to the point.""Mine could speak too," said Don Quixote, "but that is not a sufficientreason for believing that what we see is the enchanted Moor."The officer came up, and finding them engaged in such a peacefulconversation, stood amazed; though Don Quixote, to be sure, still layon his back unable to move from pure pummelling and plasters. Theofficer turned to him and said, "Well, how goes it, good man?""I would speak more politely if I were you," replied Don Quixote; "isit the way of this country to address knights-errant in that style, youbooby?"The cuadrillero finding himself so disrespectfully treated by such asorry-looking individual, lost his temper, and raising the lamp full ofoil, smote Don Quixote such a blow with it on the head that he gave hima badly broken pate; then, all being in darkness, he went out, andSancho Panza said, "That is certainly the enchanted Moor, Senor, and hekeeps the treasure for others, and for us only the cuffs andlamp-whacks.""That is the truth," answered Don Quixote, "and there is no use introubling oneself about these matters of enchantment or being angry orvexed at them, for as they are invisible and visionary we shall find noone on whom to avenge ourselves, do what we may; rise, Sancho, if thoucanst, and call the alcaide of this fortress, and get him to give me alittle oil, wine, salt, and rosemary to make the salutiferous balsam,for indeed I believe I have great need of it now, because I am losingmuch blood from the wound that phantom gave me."Sancho got up with pain enough in his bones, and went after theinnkeeper in the dark, and meeting the officer, who was looking to seewhat had become of his enemy, he said to him, "Senor, whoever you are,do us the favour and kindness to give us a little rosemary, oil, salt,and wine, for it is wanted to cure one of the best knights-errant onearth, who lies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchantedMoor that is in this inn."When the officer heard him talk in this way, he took him for a man outof his senses, and as day was now beginning to break, he opened the inngate, and calling the host, he told him what this good man wanted. Thehost furnished him with what he required, and Sancho brought it to DonQuixote, who, with his hand to his head, was bewailing the pain of theblow of the lamp, which had done him no more harm than raising a coupleof rather large lumps, and what he fancied blood was only the sweatthat flowed from him in his sufferings during the late storm. To bebrief, he took the materials, of which he made a compound, mixing themall and boiling them a good while until it seemed to him they had cometo perfection. He then asked for some vial to pour it into, and asthere was not one in the inn, he decided on putting it into a tinoil-bottle or flask of which the host made him a free gift; and overthe flask he repeated more than eighty paternosters and as many moreave-marias, salves, and credos, accompanying each word with a cross byway of benediction, at all which there were present Sancho, theinnkeeper, and the cuadrillero; for the carrier was now peacefullyengaged in attending to the comfort of his mules.This being accomplished, he felt anxious to make trial himself, on thespot, of the virtue of this precious balsam, as he considered it, andso he drank near a quart of what could not be put into the flask andremained in the pigskin in which it had been boiled; but scarcely hadhe done drinking when he began to vomit in such a way that nothing wasleft in his stomach, and with the pangs and spasms of vomiting he brokeinto a profuse sweat, on account of which he bade them cover him up andleave him alone. They did so, and he lay sleeping more than threehours, at the end of which he awoke and felt very great bodily reliefand so much ease from his bruises that he thought himself quite cured,and verily believed he had hit upon the balsam of Fierabras; and thatwith this remedy he might thenceforward, without any fear, face anykind of destruction, battle, or combat, however perilous it might be.Sancho Panza, who also regarded the amendment of his master asmiraculous, begged him to give him what was left in the pigskin, whichwas no small quantity. Don Quixote consented, and he, taking it withboth hands, in good faith and with a better will, gulped down anddrained off very little less than his master. But the fact is, that thestomach of poor Sancho was of necessity not so delicate as that of hismaster, and so, before vomiting, he was seized with such gripings andretchings, and such sweats and faintness, that verily and truly hebelieved his last hour had come, and finding himself so racked andtormented he cursed the balsam and the thief that had given it to him.Don Quixote seeing him in this state said, "It is my belief, Sancho,that this mischief comes of thy not being dubbed a knight, for I ampersuaded this liquor cannot be good for those who are not so.""If your worship knew that," returned Sancho--"woe betide me and all mykindred!--why did you let me taste it?"At this moment the draught took effect, and the poor squire began todischarge both ways at such a rate that the rush mat on which he hadthrown himself and the canvas blanket he had covering him were fit fornothing afterwards. He sweated and perspired with such paroxysms andconvulsions that not only he himself but all present thought his endhad come. This tempest and tribulation lasted about two hours, at theend of which he was left, not like his master, but so weak andexhausted that he could not stand. Don Quixote, however, who, as hasbeen said, felt himself relieved and well, was eager to take hisdeparture at once in quest of adventures, as it seemed to him that allthe time he loitered there was a fraud upon the world and those in itwho stood in need of his help and protection, all the more when he hadthe security and confidence his balsam afforded him; and so, urged bythis impulse, he saddled Rocinante himself and put the pack-saddle onhis squire's beast, whom likewise he helped to dress and mount the ass;after which he mounted his horse and turning to a corner of the inn helaid hold of a pike that stood there, to serve him by way of a lance.All that were in the inn, who were more than twenty persons, stoodwatching him; the innkeeper's daughter was likewise observing him, andhe too never took his eyes off her, and from time to time fetched asigh that he seemed to pluck up from the depths of his bowels; but theyall thought it must be from the pain he felt in his ribs; at any ratethey who had seen him plastered the night before thought so.As soon as they were both mounted, at the gate of the inn, he called tothe host and said in a very grave and measured voice, "Many and greatare the favours, Senor Alcaide, that I have received in this castle ofyours, and I remain under the deepest obligation to be grateful to youfor them all the days of my life; if I can repay them in avenging youof any arrogant foe who may have wronged you, know that my calling isno other than to aid the weak, to avenge those who suffer wrong, and tochastise perfidy. Search your memory, and if you find anything of thiskind you need only tell me of it, and I promise you by the order ofknighthood which I have received to procure you satisfaction andreparation to the utmost of your desire."The innkeeper replied to him with equal calmness, "Sir Knight, I do notwant your worship to avenge me of any wrong, because when any is doneme I can take what vengeance seems good to me; the only thing I want isthat you pay me the score that you have run up in the inn last night,as well for the straw and barley for your two beasts, as for supper andbeds."c16c.jpg (326K)Full Size"Then this is an inn?" said Don Quixote."And a very respectable one," said the innkeeper."I have been under a mistake all this time," answered Don Quixote, "forin truth I thought it was a castle, and not a bad one; but since itappears that it is not a castle but an inn, all that can be done now isthat you should excuse the payment, for I cannot contravene the rule ofknights-errant, of whom I know as a fact (and up to the present I haveread nothing to the contrary) that they never paid for lodging oranything else in the inn where they might be; for any hospitality thatmight be offered them is their due by law and right in return for theinsufferable toil they endure in seeking adventures by night and byday, in summer and in winter, on foot and on horseback, in hunger andthirst, cold and heat, exposed to all the inclemencies of heaven andall the hardships of earth.""I have little to do with that," replied the innkeeper; "pay me whatyou owe me, and let us have no more talk of chivalry, for all I careabout is to get my money.""You are a stupid, scurvy innkeeper," said Don Quixote, and puttingspurs to Rocinante and bringing his pike to the slope he rode out ofthe inn before anyone could stop him, and pushed on some distancewithout looking to see if his squire was following him.The innkeeper when he saw him go without paying him ran to get paymentof Sancho, who said that as his master would not pay neither would he,because, being as he was squire to a knight-errant, the same rule andreason held good for him as for his master with regard to not payinganything in inns and hostelries. At this the innkeeper waxed verywroth, and threatened if he did not pay to compel him in a way that hewould not like. To which Sancho made answer that by the law of chivalryhis master had received he would not pay a rap, though it cost him hislife; for the excellent and ancient usage of knights-errant was notgoing to be violated by him, nor should the squires of such as were yetto come into the world ever complain of him or reproach him withbreaking so just a privilege.The ill-luck of the unfortunate Sancho so ordered it that among thecompany in the inn there were four woolcarders from Segovia, threeneedle-makers from the Colt of Cordova, and two lodgers from the Fairof Seville, lively fellows, tender-hearted, fond of a joke, andplayful, who, almost as if instigated and moved by a common impulse,made up to Sancho and dismounted him from his ass, while one of themwent in for the blanket of the host's bed; but on flinging him into itthey looked up, and seeing that the ceiling was somewhat lower thanwhat they required for their work, they decided upon going out into theyard, which was bounded by the sky, and there, putting Sancho in themiddle of the blanket, they began to raise him high, making sport withhim as they would with a dog at Shrovetide.c16d.jpg (285K)Full SizeThe cries of the poor blanketed wretch were so loud that they reachedthe ears of his master, who, halting to listen attentively, waspersuaded that some new adventure was coming, until he clearlyperceived that it was his squire who uttered them. Wheeling about hecame up to the inn with a laborious gallop, and finding it shut wentround it to see if he could find some way of getting in; but as soon ashe came to the wall of the yard, which was not very high, he discoveredthe game that was being played with his squire. He saw him rising andfalling in the air with such grace and nimbleness that, had his rageallowed him, it is my belief he would have laughed. He tried to climbfrom his horse on to the top of the wall, but he was so bruised andbattered that he could not even dismount; and so from the back of hishorse he began to utter such maledictions and objurgations againstthose who were blanketing Sancho as it would be impossible to writedown accurately: they, however, did not stay their laughter or theirwork for this, nor did the flying Sancho cease his lamentations,mingled now with threats, now with entreaties but all to littlepurpose, or none at all, until from pure weariness they left off. Theythen brought him his ass, and mounting him on top of it they put hisjacket round him; and the compassionate Maritornes, seeing him soexhausted, thought fit to refresh him with a jug of water, and that itmight be all the cooler she fetched it from the well. Sancho took it,and as he was raising it to his mouth he was stopped by the cries ofhis master exclaiming, "Sancho, my son, drink not water; drink it not,my son, for it will kill thee; see, here I have the blessed balsam (andhe held up the flask of liquor), and with drinking two drops of it thouwilt certainly be restored."At these words Sancho turned his eyes asquint, and in a still loudervoice said, "Can it be your worship has forgotten that I am not aknight, or do you want me to end by vomiting up what bowels I have leftafter last night? Keep your liquor in the name of all the devils, andleave me to myself!" and at one and the same instant he left offtalking and began drinking; but as at the first sup he perceived it waswater he did not care to go on with it, and begged Maritornes to fetchhim some wine, which she did with right good will, and paid for it withher own money; for indeed they say of her that, though she was in thatline of life, there was some faint and distant resemblance to aChristian about her. When Sancho had done drinking he dug his heelsinto his ass, and the gate of the inn being thrown open he passed outvery well pleased at having paid nothing and carried his point, thoughit had been at the expense of his usual sureties, his shoulders. It istrue that the innkeeper detained his alforjas in payment of what wasowing to him, but Sancho took his departure in such a flurry that henever missed them. The innkeeper, as soon as he saw him off, wanted tobar the gate close, but the blanketers would not agree to it, for theywere fellows who would not have cared two farthings for Don Quixote,even had he been really one of the knights-errant of the Round Table.c17e.jpg (47K)CHAPTER XVIII.IN WHICH IS RELATED THE DISCOURSE SANCHO PANZA HELD WITH HIS MASTER,DON QUIXOTE, AND OTHER ADVENTURES WORTH RELATINGc18a.jpg (79K)Full SizeSancho reached his master so limp and faint that he could not urge onhis beast. When Don Quixote saw the state he was in he said, "I havenow come to the conclusion, good Sancho, that this castle or inn isbeyond a doubt enchanted, because those who have so atrociouslydiverted themselves with thee, what can they be but phantoms or beingsof another world? and I hold this confirmed by having noticed that whenI was by the wall of the yard witnessing the acts of thy sad tragedy,it was out of my power to mount upon it, nor could I even dismount fromRocinante, because they no doubt had me enchanted; for I swear to theeby the faith of what I am that if I had been able to climb up ordismount, I would have avenged thee in such a way that those braggartthieves would have remembered their freak for ever, even though in sodoing I knew that I contravened the laws of chivalry, which, as I haveoften told thee, do not permit a knight to lay hands on him who is notone, save in case of urgent and great necessity in defence of his ownlife and person.""I would have avenged myself too if I could," said Sancho, "whether Ihad been dubbed knight or not, but I could not; though for my part I ampersuaded those who amused themselves with me were not phantoms orenchanted men, as your worship says, but men of flesh and bone likeourselves; and they all had their names, for I heard them name themwhen they were tossing me, and one was called Pedro Martinez, andanother Tenorio Hernandez, and the innkeeper, I heard, was called JuanPalomeque the Left-handed; so that, senor, your not being able to leapover the wall of the yard or dismount from your horse came of somethingelse besides enchantments; and what I make out clearly from all thisis, that these adventures we go seeking will in the end lead us intosuch misadventures that we shall not know which is our right foot; andthat the best and wisest thing, according to my small wits, would befor us to return home, now that it is harvest-time, and attend to ourbusiness, and give over wandering from Zeca to Mecca and from pail tobucket, as the saying is.""How little thou knowest about chivalry, Sancho," replied Don Quixote;"hold thy peace and have patience; the day will come when thou shaltsee with thine own eyes what an honourable thing it is to wander in thepursuit of this calling; nay, tell me, what greater pleasure can therebe in the world, or what delight can equal that of winning a battle,and triumphing over one's enemy? None, beyond all doubt.""Very likely," answered Sancho, "though I do not know it; all I know isthat since we have been knights-errant, or since your worship has beenone (for I have no right to reckon myself one of so honourable anumber) we have never won any battle except the one with the Biscayan,and even out of that your worship came with half an ear and half ahelmet the less; and from that till now it has been all cudgellings andmore cudgellings, cuffs and more cuffs, I getting the blanketing overand above, and falling in with enchanted persons on whom I cannotavenge myself so as to know what the delight, as your worship calls it,of conquering an enemy is like.""That is what vexes me, and what ought to vex thee, Sancho," repliedDon Quixote; "but henceforward I will endeavour to have at hand somesword made by such craft that no kind of enchantments can take effectupon him who carries it, and it is even possible that fortune mayprocure for me that which belonged to Amadis when he was called 'TheKnight of the Burning Sword,' which was one of the best swords thatever knight in the world possessed, for, besides having the saidvirtue, it cut like a razor, and there was no armour, however strongand enchanted it might be, that could resist it.""Such is my luck," said Sancho, "that even if that happened and yourworship found some such sword, it would, like the balsam, turn outserviceable and good for dubbed knights only, and as for the squires,they might sup sorrow.""Fear not that, Sancho," said Don Quixote: "Heaven will deal better bythee."Thus talking, Don Quixote and his squire were going along, when, on theroad they were following, Don Quixote perceived approaching them alarge and thick cloud of dust, on seeing which he turned to Sancho andsaid:"This is the day, Sancho, on which will be seen the boon my fortune isreserving for me; this, I say, is the day on which as much as on anyother shall be displayed the might of my arm, and on which I shall dodeeds that shall remain written in the book of fame for all ages tocome. Seest thou that cloud of dust which rises yonder? Well, then, allthat is churned up by a vast army composed of various and countlessnations that comes marching there.""According to that there must be two," said Sancho, "for on thisopposite side also there rises just such another cloud of dust."Don Quixote turned to look and found that it was true, and rejoicingexceedingly, he concluded that they were two armies about to engage andencounter in the midst of that broad plain; for at all times andseasons his fancy was full of the battles, enchantments, adventures,crazy feats, loves, and defiances that are recorded in the books ofchivalry, and everything he said, thought, or did had reference to suchthings. Now the cloud of dust he had seen was raised by two greatdroves of sheep coming along the same road in opposite directions,which, because of the dust, did not become visible until they drewnear, but Don Quixote asserted so positively that they were armies thatSancho was led to believe it and say, "Well, and what are we to do,senor?"c17b.jpg (339K)Full Size"What?" said Don Quixote: "give aid and assistance to the weak andthose who need it; and thou must know, Sancho, that this which comesopposite to us is conducted and led by the mighty emperor Alifanfaron,lord of the great isle of Trapobana; this other that marches behind meis that of his enemy the king of the Garamantas, Pentapolin of the BareArm, for he always goes into battle with his right arm bare.""But why are these two lords such enemies?""They are at enmity," replied Don Quixote, "because this Alifanfaron isa furious pagan and is in love with the daughter of Pentapolin, who isa very beautiful and moreover gracious lady, and a Christian, and herfather is unwilling to bestow her upon the pagan king unless he firstabandons the religion of his false prophet Mahomet, and adopts hisown.""By my beard," said Sancho, "but Pentapolin does quite right, and Iwill help him as much as I can.""In that thou wilt do what is thy duty, Sancho," said Don Quixote; "forto engage in battles of this sort it is not requisite to be a dubbedknight.""That I can well understand," answered Sancho; "but where shall we putthis ass where we may be sure to find him after the fray is over? for Ibelieve it has not been the custom so far to go into battle on a beastof this kind.""That is true," said Don Quixote, "and what you had best do with him isto leave him to take his chance whether he be lost or not, for thehorses we shall have when we come out victors will be so many that evenRocinante will run a risk of being changed for another. But attend tome and observe, for I wish to give thee some account of the chiefknights who accompany these two armies; and that thou mayest the bettersee and mark, let us withdraw to that hillock which rises yonder,whence both armies may be seen."They did so, and placed themselves on a rising ground from which thetwo droves that Don Quixote made armies of might have been plainly seenif the clouds of dust they raised had not obscured them and blinded thesight; nevertheless, seeing in his imagination what he did not see andwhat did not exist, he began thus in a loud voice:"That knight whom thou seest yonder in yellow armour, who bears uponhis shield a lion crowned crouching at the feet of a damsel, is thevaliant Laurcalco, lord of the Silver Bridge; that one in armour withflowers of gold, who bears on his shield three crowns argent on anazure field, is the dreaded Micocolembo, grand duke of Quirocia; thatother of gigantic frame, on his right hand, is the ever dauntlessBrandabarbaran de Boliche, lord of the three Arabias, who for armourwears that serpent skin, and has for shield a gate which, according totradition, is one of those of the temple that Samson brought to theground when by his death he revenged himself upon his enemies. But turnthine eyes to the other side, and thou shalt see in front and in thevan of this other army the ever victorious and never vanquished Timonelof Carcajona, prince of New Biscay, who comes in armour with armsquartered azure, vert, white, and yellow, and bears on his shield a cator on a field tawny with a motto which says _Miau_, which is thebeginning of the name of his lady, who according to report is thepeerless Miaulina, daughter of the duke Alfeniquen of the Algarve; theother, who burdens and presses the loins of that powerful charger andbears arms white as snow and a shield blank and without any device, isa novice knight, a Frenchman by birth, Pierres Papin by name, lord ofthe baronies of Utrique; that other, who with iron-shod heels strikesthe flanks of that nimble parti-coloured zebra, and for arms bearsazure vair, is the mighty duke of Nerbia, Espartafilardo del Bosque,who bears for device on his shield an asparagus plant with a motto inCastilian that says, _'Rastrea mi suerte'_." And so he went on naming anumber of knights of one squadron or the other out of his imagination,and to all he assigned off-hand their arms, colours, devices, andmottoes, carried away by the illusions of his unheard-of craze; andwithout a pause, he continued, "People of divers nations compose thissquadron in front; here are those that drink of the sweet waters of thefamous Xanthus, those that scour the woody Massilian plains, those thatsift the pure fine gold of Arabia Felix, those that enjoy the famedcool banks of the crystal Thermodon, those that in many and variousways divert the streams of the golden Pactolus, the Numidians,faithless in their promises, the Persians renowned in archery, theParthians and the Medes that fight as they fly, the Arabs that evershift their dwellings, the Scythians as cruel as they are fair, theEthiopians with pierced lips, and an infinity of other nations whosefeatures I recognise and descry, though I cannot recall their names. Inthis other squadron there come those that drink of the crystal streamsof the olive-bearing Betis, those that make smooth their countenanceswith the water of the ever rich and golden Tagus, those that rejoice inthe fertilising flow of the divine Genil, those that roam the Tartesianplains abounding in pasture, those that take their pleasure in theElysian meadows of Jerez, the rich Manchegans crowned with ruddy earsof corn, the wearers of iron, old relics of the Gothic race, those thatbathe in the Pisuerga renowned for its gentle current, those that feedtheir herds along the spreading pastures of the winding Guadiana famedfor its hidden course, those that tremble with the cold of the pinecladPyrenees or the dazzling snows of the lofty Apennine; in a word, asmany as all Europe includes and contains."Good God! what a number of countries and nations he named! giving toeach its proper attributes with marvellous readiness; brimful andsaturated with what he had read in his lying books! Sancho Panza hungupon his words without speaking, and from time to time turned to try ifhe could see the knights and giants his master was describing, and ashe could not make out one of them he said to him:"Senor, devil take it if there's a sign of any man you talk of, knightor giant, in the whole thing; maybe it's all enchantment, like thephantoms last night.""How canst thou say that!" answered Don Quixote; "dost thou not hearthe neighing of the steeds, the braying of the trumpets, the roll ofthe drums?""I hear nothing but a great bleating of ewes and sheep," said Sancho;which was true, for by this time the two flocks had come close."The fear thou art in, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "prevents thee fromseeing or hearing correctly, for one of the effects of fear is toderange the senses and make things appear different from what they are;if thou art in such fear, withdraw to one side and leave me to myself,for alone I suffice to bring victory to that side to which I shall givemy aid;" and so saying he gave Rocinante the spur, and putting thelance in rest, shot down the slope like a thunderbolt. Sancho shoutedafter him, crying, "Come back, Senor Don Quixote; I vow to God they aresheep and ewes you are charging! Come back! Unlucky the father thatbegot me! what madness is this! Look, there is no giant, nor knight,nor cats, nor arms, nor shields quartered or whole, nor vair azure orbedevilled. What are you about? Sinner that I am before God!" But notfor all these entreaties did Don Quixote turn back; on the contrary hewent on shouting out, "Ho, knights, ye who follow and fight under thebanners of the valiant emperor Pentapolin of the Bare Arm, follow meall; ye shall see how easily I shall give him his revenge over hisenemy Alifanfaron of the Trapobana."So saying, he dashed into the midst of the squadron of ewes, and beganspearing them with as much spirit and intrepidity as if he weretransfixing mortal enemies in earnest. The shepherds and droversaccompanying the flock shouted to him to desist; seeing it was no use,they ungirt their slings and began to salute his ears with stones asbig as one's fist. Don Quixote gave no heed to the stones, but, lettingdrive right and left kept saying:"Where art thou, proud Alifanfaron? Come before me; I am a singleknight who would fain prove thy prowess hand to hand, and make theeyield thy life a penalty for the wrong thou dost to the valiantPentapolin Garamanta." Here came a sugar-plum from the brook thatstruck him on the side and buried a couple of ribs in his body. Feelinghimself so smitten, he imagined himself slain or badly wounded forcertain, and recollecting his liquor he drew out his flask, and puttingit to his mouth began to pour the contents into his stomach; but ere hehad succeeded in swallowing what seemed to him enough, there cameanother almond which struck him on the hand and on the flask so fairlythat it smashed it to pieces, knocking three or four teeth and grindersout of his mouth in its course, and sorely crushing two fingers of hishand. Such was the force of the first blow and of the second, that thepoor knight in spite of himself came down backwards off his horse. Theshepherds came up, and felt sure they had killed him; so in all hastethey collected their flock together, took up the dead beasts, of whichthere were more than seven, and made off without waiting to ascertainanything further.All this time Sancho stood on the hill watching the crazy feats hismaster was performing, and tearing his beard and cursing the hour andthe occasion when fortune had made him acquainted with him. Seeing him,then, brought to the ground, and that the shepherds had takenthemselves off, he ran to him and found him in very bad case, thoughnot unconscious; and said he:"Did I not tell you to come back, Senor Don Quixote; and that what youwere going to attack were not armies but droves of sheep?""That's how that thief of a sage, my enemy, can alter and falsifythings," answered Don Quixote; "thou must know, Sancho, that it is avery easy matter for those of his sort to make us believe what theychoose; and this malignant being who persecutes me, envious of theglory he knew I was to win in this battle, has turned the squadrons ofthe enemy into droves of sheep. At any rate, do this much, I beg ofthee, Sancho, to undeceive thyself, and see that what I say is true;mount thy ass and follow them quietly, and thou shalt see that whenthey have gone some little distance from this they will return to theiroriginal shape and, ceasing to be sheep, become men in all respects asI described them to thee at first. But go not just yet, for I want thyhelp and assistance; come hither, and see how many of my teeth andgrinders are missing, for I feel as if there was not one left in mymouth."Sancho came so close that he almost put his eyes into his mouth; nowjust at that moment the balsam had acted on the stomach of Don Quixote,so, at the very instant when Sancho came to examine his mouth, hedischarged all its contents with more force than a musket, and fullinto the beard of the compassionate squire."Holy Mary!" cried Sancho, "what is this that has happened me? Clearlythis sinner is mortally wounded, as he vomits blood from the mouth;"but considering the matter a little more closely he perceived by thecolour, taste, and smell, that it was not blood but the balsam from theflask which he had seen him drink; and he was taken with such aloathing that his stomach turned, and he vomited up his inside over hisvery master, and both were left in a precious state. Sancho ran to hisass to get something wherewith to clean himself, and relieve hismaster, out of his alforjas; but not finding them, he well-nigh tookleave of his senses, and cursed himself anew, and in his heart resolvedto quit his master and return home, even though he forfeited the wagesof his service and all hopes of the promised island.Don Quixote now rose, and putting his left hand to his mouth to keephis teeth from falling out altogether, with the other he laid hold ofthe bridle of Rocinante, who had never stirred from his master'sside--so loyal and well-behaved was he--and betook himself to where thesquire stood leaning over his ass with his hand to his cheek, like onein deep dejection. Seeing him in this mood, looking so sad, Don Quixotesaid to him:"Bear in mind, Sancho, that one man is no more than another, unless hedoes more than another; all these tempests that fall upon us are signsthat fair weather is coming shortly, and that things will go well withus, for it is impossible for good or evil to last for ever; and henceit follows that the evil having lasted long, the good must be now nighat hand; so thou must not distress thyself at the misfortunes whichhappen to me, since thou hast no share in them.""How have I not?" replied Sancho; "was he whom they blanketed yesterdayperchance any other than my father's son? and the alforjas that aremissing to-day with all my treasures, did they belong to any other butmyself?""What! are the alforjas missing, Sancho?" said Don Quixote."Yes, they are missing," answered Sancho."In that case we have nothing to eat to-day," replied Don Quixote."It would be so," answered Sancho, "if there were none of the herbsyour worship says you know in these meadows, those with whichknights-errant as unlucky as your worship are wont to supply such-likeshortcomings.""For all that," answered Don Quixote, "I would rather have just now aquarter of bread, or a loaf and a couple of pilchards' heads, than allthe herbs described by Dioscorides, even with Doctor Laguna's notes.Nevertheless, Sancho the Good, mount thy beast and come along with me,for God, who provides for all things, will not fail us (more especiallywhen we are so active in his service as we are), since he fails not themidges of the air, nor the grubs of the earth, nor the tadpoles of thewater, and is so merciful that he maketh his sun to rise on the goodand on the evil, and sendeth rain on the unjust and on the just.""Your worship would make a better preacher than knight-errant," saidSancho."Knights-errant knew and ought to know everything, Sancho," said DonQuixote; "for there were knights-errant in former times as wellqualified to deliver a sermon or discourse in the middle of anencampment, as if they had graduated in the University of Paris;whereby we may see that the lance has never blunted the pen, nor thepen the lance.""Well, be it as your worship says," replied Sancho; "let us be off nowand find some place of shelter for the night, and God grant it may besomewhere where there are no blankets, nor blanketeers, nor phantoms,nor enchanted Moors; for if there are, may the devil take the wholeconcern.""Ask that of God, my son," said Don Quixote; and do thou lead on wherethou wilt, for this time I leave our lodging to thy choice; but reachme here thy hand, and feel with thy finger, and find out how many of myteeth and grinders are missing from this right side of the upper jaw,for it is there I feel the pain."Sancho put in his fingers, and feeling about asked him, "How manygrinders used your worship have on this side?""Four," replied Don Quixote, "besides the back-tooth, all whole andquite sound.""Mind what you are saying, senor.""I say four, if not five," answered Don Quixote, "for never in my lifehave I had tooth or grinder drawn, nor has any fallen out or beendestroyed by any decay or rheum.""Well, then," said Sancho, "in this lower side your worship has no morethan two grinders and a half, and in the upper neither a half nor anyat all, for it is all as smooth as the palm of my hand.""Luckless that I am!" said Don Quixote, hearing the sad news his squiregave him; "I had rather they despoiled me of an arm, so it were not thesword-arm; for I tell thee, Sancho, a mouth without teeth is like amill without a millstone, and a tooth is much more to be prized than adiamond; but we who profess the austere order of chivalry are liable toall this. Mount, friend, and lead the way, and I will follow thee atwhatever pace thou wilt."Sancho did as he bade him, and proceeded in the direction in which hethought he might find refuge without quitting the high road, which wasthere very much frequented. As they went along, then, at a slowpace--for the pain in Don Quixote's jaws kept him uneasy andill-disposed for speed--Sancho thought it well to amuse and divert himby talk of some kind, and among the things he said to him was thatwhich will be told in the following chapter.c18e.jpg (44K)CHAPTER XIX.OF THE SHREWD DISCOURSE WHICH SANCHO HELD WITH HIS MASTER, AND OF THEADVENTURE THAT BEFELL HIM WITH A DEAD BODY, TOGETHER WITH OTHER NOTABLEOCCURRENCES"It seems to me, senor, that all these mishaps that have befallen us oflate have been without any doubt a punishment for the offence committedby your worship against the order of chivalry in not keeping the oathyou made not to eat bread off a tablecloth or embrace the queen, andall the rest of it that your worship swore to observe until you hadtaken that helmet of Malandrino's, or whatever the Moor is called, forI do not very well remember.""Thou art very right, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "but to tell thetruth, it had escaped my memory; and likewise thou mayest rely upon itthat the affair of the blanket happened to thee because of thy fault innot reminding me of it in time; but I will make amends, for there areways of compounding for everything in the order of chivalry.""Why! have I taken an oath of some sort, then?" said Sancho."It makes no matter that thou hast not taken an oath," said DonQuixote; "suffice it that I see thou art not quite clear of complicity;and whether or no, it will not be ill done to provide ourselves with aremedy.""In that case," said Sancho, "mind that your worship does not forgetthis as you did the oath; perhaps the phantoms may take it into theirheads to amuse themselves once more with me; or even with your worshipif they see you so obstinate."While engaged in this and other talk, night overtook them on the roadbefore they had reached or discovered any place of shelter; and whatmade it still worse was that they were dying of hunger, for with theloss of the alforjas they had lost their entire larder andcommissariat; and to complete the misfortune they met with an adventurewhich without any invention had really the appearance of one. It sohappened that the night closed in somewhat darkly, but for all thatthey pushed on, Sancho feeling sure that as the road was the king'shighway they might reasonably expect to find some inn within a leagueor two. Going along, then, in this way, the night dark, the squirehungry, the master sharp-set, they saw coming towards them on the roadthey were travelling a great number of lights which looked exactly likestars in motion. Sancho was taken aback at the sight of them, nor didDon Quixote altogether relish them: the one pulled up his ass by thehalter, the other his hack by the bridle, and they stood still,watching anxiously to see what all this would turn out to be, and foundthat the lights were approaching them, and the nearer they came thegreater they seemed, at which spectacle Sancho began to shake like aman dosed with mercury, and Don Quixote's hair stood on end; he,however, plucking up spirit a little, said:"This, no doubt, Sancho, will be a most mighty and perilous adventure,in which it will be needful for me to put forth all my valour andresolution.""Unlucky me!" answered Sancho; "if this adventure happens to be one ofphantoms, as I am beginning to think it is, where shall I find the ribsto bear it?""Be they phantoms ever so much," said Don Quixote, "I will not permitthem to touch a thread of thy garments; for if they played tricks withthee the time before, it was because I was unable to leap the walls ofthe yard; but now we are on a wide plain, where I shall be able towield my sword as I please.""And if they enchant and cripple you as they did the last time," saidSancho, "what difference will it make being on the open plain or not?""For all that," replied Don Quixote, "I entreat thee, Sancho, to keep agood heart, for experience will tell thee what mine is.""I will, please God," answered Sancho, and the two retiring to one sideof the road set themselves to observe closely what all these movinglights might be; and very soon afterwards they made out some twentyencamisados, all on horseback, with lighted torches in their hands, theawe-inspiring aspect of whom completely extinguished the courage ofSancho, who began to chatter with his teeth like one in the cold fit ofan ague; and his heart sank and his teeth chattered still more whenthey perceived distinctly that behind them there came a litter coveredover with black and followed by six more mounted figures in mourningdown to the very feet of their mules--for they could perceive plainlythey were not horses by the easy pace at which they went. And as theencamisados came along they muttered to themselves in a low plaintivetone. This strange spectacle at such an hour and in such a solitaryplace was quite enough to strike terror into Sancho's heart, and eveninto his master's; and (save in Don Quixote's case) did so, for allSancho's resolution had now broken down. It was just the opposite withhis master, whose imagination immediately conjured up all this to himvividly as one of the adventures of his books.He took it into his head that the litter was a bier on which was bornesome sorely wounded or slain knight, to avenge whom was a task reservedfor him alone; and without any further reasoning he laid his lance inrest, fixed himself firmly in his saddle, and with gallant spirit andbearing took up his position in the middle of the road where theencamisados must of necessity pass; and as soon as he saw them near athand he raised his voice and said:"Halt, knights, or whosoever ye may be, and render me account of who yeare, whence ye come, where ye go, what it is ye carry upon that bier,for, to judge by appearances, either ye have done some wrong or somewrong has been done to you, and it is fitting and necessary that Ishould know, either that I may chastise you for the evil ye have done,or else that I may avenge you for the injury that has been inflictedupon you.""We are in haste," answered one of the encamisados, "and the inn is faroff, and we cannot stop to render you such an account as you demand;"and spurring his mule he moved on.Don Quixote was mightily provoked by this answer, and seizing the muleby the bridle he said, "Halt, and be more mannerly, and render anaccount of what I have asked of you; else, take my defiance to combat,all of you."The mule was shy, and was so frightened at her bridle being seized thatrearing up she flung her rider to the ground over her haunches. Anattendant who was on foot, seeing the encamisado fall, began to abuseDon Quixote, who now moved to anger, without any more ado, laying hislance in rest charged one of the men in mourning and brought him badlywounded to the ground, and as he wheeled round upon the others theagility with which he attacked and routed them was a sight to see, forit seemed just as if wings had that instant grown upon Rocinante, solightly and proudly did he bear himself. The encamisados were all timidfolk and unarmed, so they speedily made their escape from the fray andset off at a run across the plain with their lighted torches, lookingexactly like maskers running on some gala or festival night. Themourners, too, enveloped and swathed in their skirts and gowns, wereunable to bestir themselves, and so with entire safety to himself DonQuixote belaboured them all and drove them off against their will, forthey all thought it was no man but a devil from hell come to carry awaythe dead body they had in the litter.Sancho beheld all this in astonishment at the intrepidity of his lord,and said to himself, "Clearly this master of mine is as bold andvaliant as he says he is."A burning torch lay on the ground near the first man whom the mule hadthrown, by the light of which Don Quixote perceived him, and coming upto him he presented the point of the lance to his face, calling on himto yield himself prisoner, or else he would kill him; to which theprostrate man replied, "I am prisoner enough as it is; I cannot stir,for one of my legs is broken: I entreat you, if you be a Christiangentleman, not to kill me, which will be committing grave sacrilege,for I am a licentiate and I hold first orders.""Then what the devil brought you here, being a churchman?" said DonQuixote."What, senor?" said the other. "My bad luck.""Then still worse awaits you," said Don Quixote, "if you do not satisfyme as to all I asked you at first.""You shall be soon satisfied," said the licentiate; "you must know,then, that though just now I said I was a licentiate, I am only abachelor, and my name is Alonzo Lopez; I am a native of Alcobendas, Icome from the city of Baeza with eleven others, priests, the same whofled with the torches, and we are going to the city of Segoviaaccompanying a dead body which is in that litter, and is that of agentleman who died in Baeza, where he was interred; and now, as I said,we are taking his bones to their burial-place, which is in Segovia,where he was born.""And who killed him?" asked Don Quixote."God, by means of a malignant fever that took him," answered thebachelor."In that case," said Don Quixote, "the Lord has relieved me of the taskof avenging his death had any other slain him; but, he who slew himhaving slain him, there is nothing for it but to be silent, and shrugone's shoulders; I should do the same were he to slay myself; and Iwould have your reverence know that I am a knight of La Mancha, DonQuixote by name, and it is my business and calling to roam the worldrighting wrongs and redressing injuries.""I do not know how that about righting wrongs can be," said thebachelor, "for from straight you have made me crooked, leaving me witha broken leg that will never see itself straight again all the days ofits life; and the injury you have redressed in my case has been toleave me injured in such a way that I shall remain injured for ever;and the height of misadventure it was to fall in with you who go insearch of adventures.""Things do not all happen in the same way," answered Don Quixote; "itall came, Sir Bachelor Alonzo Lopez, of your going, as you did, bynight, dressed in those surplices, with lighted torches, praying,covered with mourning, so that naturally you looked like something eviland of the other world; and so I could not avoid doing my duty inattacking you, and I should have attacked you even had I knownpositively that you were the very devils of hell, for such I certainlybelieved and took you to be.""As my fate has so willed it," said the bachelor, "I entreat you, sirknight-errant, whose errand has been such an evil one for me, to helpme to get from under this mule that holds one of my legs caught betweenthe stirrup and the saddle.""I would have talked on till to-morrow," said Don Quixote; "how longwere you going to wait before telling me of your distress?"He at once called to Sancho, who, however, had no mind to come, as hewas just then engaged in unloading a sumpter mule, well laden withprovender, which these worthy gentlemen had brought with them. Sanchomade a bag of his coat, and, getting together as much as he could, andas the bag would hold, he loaded his beast, and then hastened to obeyhis master's call, and helped him to remove the bachelor from under themule; then putting him on her back he gave him the torch, and DonQuixote bade him follow the track of his companions, and beg pardon ofthem on his part for the wrong which he could not help doing them.And said Sancho, "If by chance these gentlemen should want to know whowas the hero that served them so, your worship may tell them that he isthe famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called the Knight of theRueful Countenance."The bachelor then took his departure.I forgot to mention that before he did so he said to Don Quixote,"Remember that you stand excommunicated for having laid violent handson a holy thing, _juxta illud, si quis, suadente diabolo_.""I do not understand that Latin," answered Don Quixote, "but I knowwell I did not lay hands, only this pike; besides, I did not think Iwas committing an assault upon priests or things of the Church, which,like a Catholic and faithful Christian as I am, I respect and revere,but upon phantoms and spectres of the other world; but even so, Iremember how it fared with Cid Ruy Diaz when he broke the chair of theambassador of that king before his Holiness the Pope, whoexcommunicated him for the same; and yet the good Roderick of Vivarbore himself that day like a very noble and valiant knight."On hearing this the bachelor took his departure, as has been said,without making any reply; and Don Quixote asked Sancho what had inducedhim to call him the "Knight of the Rueful Countenance" more then thanat any other time."I will tell you," answered Sancho; "it was because I have been lookingat you for some time by the light of the torch held by thatunfortunate, and verily your worship has got of late the mostill-favoured countenance I ever saw: it must be either owing to thefatigue of this combat, or else to the want of teeth and grinders.""It is not that," replied Don Quixote, "but because the sage whose dutyit will be to write the history of my achievements must have thought itproper that I should take some distinctive name as all knights of yoredid; one being 'He of the Burning Sword,' another 'He of the Unicorn,'this one 'He of the Damsels,' that 'He of the Phoenix,' another 'TheKnight of the Griffin,' and another 'He of the Death,' and by thesenames and designations they were known all the world round; and so Isay that the sage aforesaid must have put it into your mouth and mindjust now to call me 'The Knight of the Rueful Countenance,' as I intendto call myself from this day forward; and that the said name may fit mebetter, I mean, when the opportunity offers, to have a very ruefulcountenance painted on my shield.""There is no occasion, senor, for wasting time or money on making thatcountenance," said Sancho; "for all that need be done is for yourworship to show your own, face to face, to those who look at you, andwithout anything more, either image or shield, they will call you 'Himof the Rueful Countenance' and believe me I am telling you the truth,for I assure you, senor (and in good part be it said), hunger and theloss of your grinders have given you such an ill-favoured face that, asI say, the rueful picture may be very well spared."Don Quixote laughed at Sancho's pleasantry; nevertheless he resolved tocall himself by that name, and have his shield or buckler painted as hehad devised.Don Quixote would have looked to see whether the body in the litterwere bones or not, but Sancho would not have it, saying:"Senor, you have ended this perilous adventure more safely for yourselfthan any of those I have seen: perhaps these people, though beaten androuted, may bethink themselves that it is a single man that has beatenthem, and feeling sore and ashamed of it may take heart and come insearch of us and give us trouble enough. The ass is in proper trim, themountains are near at hand, hunger presses, we have nothing more to dobut make good our retreat, and, as the saying is, the dead to the graveand the living to the loaf."And driving his ass before him he begged his master to follow, who,feeling that Sancho was right, did so without replying; and afterproceeding some little distance between two hills they found themselvesin a wide and retired valley, where they alighted, and Sancho unloadedhis beast, and stretched upon the green grass, with hunger for sauce,they breakfasted, dined, lunched, and supped all at once, satisfyingtheir appetites with more than one store of cold meat which the deadman's clerical gentlemen (who seldom put themselves on short allowance)had brought with them on their sumpter mule. But another piece ofill-luck befell them, which Sancho held the worst of all, and that wasthat they had no wine to drink, nor even water to moisten their lips;and as thirst tormented them, Sancho, observing that the meadow wherethey were was full of green and tender grass, said what will be told inthe following chapter.CHAPTER XX.OF THE UNEXAMPLED AND UNHEARD-OF ADVENTURE WHICH WAS ACHIEVED BY THEVALIANT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WITH LESS PERIL THAN ANY EVER ACHIEVEDBY ANY FAMOUS KNIGHT IN THE WORLDc19a.jpg (147K)Full Size"It cannot be, senor, but that this grass is a proof that there must behard by some spring or brook to give it moisture, so it would be wellto move a little farther on, that we may find some place where we mayquench this terrible thirst that plagues us, which beyond a doubt ismore distressing than hunger."The advice seemed good to Don Quixote, and, he leading Rocinante by thebridle and Sancho the ass by the halter, after he had packed away uponhim the remains of the supper, they advanced the meadow feeling theirway, for the darkness of the night made it impossible to see anything;but they had not gone two hundred paces when a loud noise of water, asif falling from great rocks, struck their ears. The sound cheered themgreatly; but halting to make out by listening from what quarter it camethey heard unseasonably another noise which spoiled the satisfactionthe sound of the water gave them, especially for Sancho, who was bynature timid and faint-hearted. They heard, I say, strokes falling witha measured beat, and a certain rattling of iron and chains that,together with the furious din of the water, would have struck terrorinto any heart but Don Quixote's. The night was, as has been said,dark, and they had happened to reach a spot in among some tall trees,whose leaves stirred by a gentle breeze made a low ominous sound; sothat, what with the solitude, the place, the darkness, the noise of thewater, and the rustling of the leaves, everything inspired awe anddread; more especially as they perceived that the strokes did notcease, nor the wind lull, nor morning approach; to all which might beadded their ignorance as to where they were.c19b.jpg (204K)Full SizeBut Don Quixote, supported by his intrepid heart, leaped on Rocinante,and bracing his buckler on his arm, brought his pike to the slope, andsaid, "Friend Sancho, know that I by Heaven's will have been born inthis our iron age to revive in it the age of gold, or the golden as itis called; I am he for whom perils, mighty achievements, and valiantdeeds are reserved; I am, I say again, he who is to revive the Knightsof the Round Table, the Twelve of France and the Nine Worthies; and hewho is to consign to oblivion the Platirs, the Tablantes, the Olivantesand Tirantes, the Phoebuses and Belianises, with the whole herd offamous knights-errant of days gone by, performing in these in which Ilive such exploits, marvels, and feats of arms as shall obscure theirbrightest deeds. Thou dost mark well, faithful and trusty squire, thegloom of this night, its strange silence, the dull confused murmur ofthose trees, the awful sound of that water in quest of which we came,that seems as though it were precipitating and dashing itself down fromthe lofty mountains of the Moon, and that incessant hammering thatwounds and pains our ears; which things all together and each of itselfare enough to instil fear, dread, and dismay into the breast of Marshimself, much more into one not used to hazards and adventures of thekind. Well, then, all this that I put before thee is but an incentiveand stimulant to my spirit, making my heart burst in my bosom througheagerness to engage in this adventure, arduous as it promises to be;therefore tighten Rocinante's girths a little, and God be with thee;wait for me here three days and no more, and if in that time I come notback, thou canst return to our village, and thence, to do me a favourand a service, thou wilt go to El Toboso, where thou shalt say to myincomparable lady Dulcinea that her captive knight hath died inattempting things that might make him worthy of being called hers."When Sancho heard his master's words he began to weep in the mostpathetic way, saying:"Senor, I know not why your worship wants to attempt this so dreadfuladventure; it is night now, no one sees us here, we can easily turnabout and take ourselves out of danger, even if we don't drink forthree days to come; and as there is no one to see us, all the less willthere be anyone to set us down as cowards; besides, I have many a timeheard the curate of our village, whom your worship knows well, preachthat he who seeks danger perishes in it; so it is not right to temptGod by trying so tremendous a feat from which there can be no escapesave by a miracle, and Heaven has performed enough of them for yourworship in delivering you from being blanketed as I was, and bringingyou out victorious and safe and sound from among all those enemies thatwere with the dead man; and if all this does not move or soften thathard heart, let this thought and reflection move it, that you will havehardly quitted this spot when from pure fear I shall yield my soul upto anyone that will take it. I left home and wife and children to comeand serve your worship, trusting to do better and not worse; but ascovetousness bursts the bag, it has rent my hopes asunder, for just asI had them highest about getting that wretched unlucky island yourworship has so often promised me, I see that instead and in lieu of ityou mean to desert me now in a place so far from human reach: for God'ssake, master mine, deal not so unjustly by me, and if your worship willnot entirely give up attempting this feat, at least put it off tillmorning, for by what the lore I learned when I was a shepherd tells meit cannot want three hours of dawn now, because the mouth of the Hornis overhead and makes midnight in the line of the left arm.""How canst thou see, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "where it makes thatline, or where this mouth or this occiput is that thou talkest of, whenthe night is so dark that there is not a star to be seen in the wholeheaven?""That's true," said Sancho, "but fear has sharp eyes, and sees thingsunderground, much more above in heavens; besides, there is good reasonto show that it now wants but little of day.""Let it want what it may," replied Don Quixote, "it shall not be saidof me now or at any time that tears or entreaties turned me aside fromdoing what was in accordance with knightly usage; and so I beg of thee,Sancho, to hold thy peace, for God, who has put it into my heart toundertake now this so unexampled and terrible adventure, will take careto watch over my safety and console thy sorrow; what thou hast to do isto tighten Rocinante's girths well, and wait here, for I shall comeback shortly, alive or dead."Sancho perceiving it his master's final resolve, and how little histears, counsels, and entreaties prevailed with him, determined to haverecourse to his own ingenuity and compel him, if he could, to wait tilldaylight; and so, while tightening the girths of the horse, he quietlyand without being felt, with his ass' halter tied both Rocinante'slegs, so that when Don Quixote strove to go he was unable as the horsecould only move by jumps. Seeing the success of his trick, Sancho Panzasaid:"See there, senor! Heaven, moved by my tears and prayers, has soordered it that Rocinante cannot stir; and if you will be obstinate,and spur and strike him, you will only provoke fortune, and kick, asthey say, against the pricks."Don Quixote at this grew desperate, but the more he drove his heelsinto the horse, the less he stirred him; and not having any suspicionof the tying, he was fain to resign himself and wait till daybreak oruntil Rocinante could move, firmly persuaded that all this came ofsomething other than Sancho's ingenuity. So he said to him, "As it isso, Sancho, and as Rocinante cannot move, I am content to wait tilldawn smiles upon us, even though I weep while it delays its coming.""There is no need to weep," answered Sancho, "for I will amuse yourworship by telling stories from this till daylight, unless indeed youlike to dismount and lie down to sleep a little on the green grassafter the fashion of knights-errant, so as to be fresher when day comesand the moment arrives for attempting this extraordinary adventure youare looking forward to.""What art thou talking about dismounting or sleeping for?" said DonQuixote. "Am I, thinkest thou, one of those knights that take theirrest in the presence of danger? Sleep thou who art born to sleep, or doas thou wilt, for I will act as I think most consistent with mycharacter.""Be not angry, master mine," replied Sancho, "I did not mean to saythat;" and coming close to him he laid one hand on the pommel of thesaddle and the other on the cantle so that he held his master's leftthigh in his embrace, not daring to separate a finger's width from him;so much afraid was he of the strokes which still resounded with aregular beat. Don Quixote bade him tell some story to amuse him as hehad proposed, to which Sancho replied that he would if his dread ofwhat he heard would let him; "Still," said he, "I will strive to tell astory which, if I can manage to relate it, and nobody interferes withthe telling, is the best of stories, and let your worship give me yourattention, for here I begin. What was, was; and may the good that is tocome be for all, and the evil for him who goes to look for it--yourworship must know that the beginning the old folk used to put to theirtales was not just as each one pleased; it was a maxim of CatoZonzorino the Roman, that says 'the evil for him that goes to look forit,' and it comes as pat to the purpose now as ring to finger, to showthat your worship should keep quiet and not go looking for evil in anyquarter, and that we should go back by some other road, since nobodyforces us to follow this in which so many terrors affright us.""Go on with thy story, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "and leave the choiceof our road to my care.""I say then," continued Sancho, "that in a village of Estremadura therewas a goat-shepherd--that is to say, one who tended goats--which shepherdor goatherd, as my story goes, was called Lope Ruiz, and this Lope Ruizwas in love with a shepherdess called Torralva, which shepherdesscalled Torralva was the daughter of a rich grazier, and this richgrazier--""If that is the way thou tellest thy tale, Sancho," said Don Quixote,"repeating twice all thou hast to say, thou wilt not have done thesetwo days; go straight on with it, and tell it like a reasonable man, orelse say nothing.""Tales are always told in my country in the very way I am tellingthis," answered Sancho, "and I cannot tell it in any other, nor is itright of your worship to ask me to make new customs.""Tell it as thou wilt," replied Don Quixote; "and as fate will have itthat I cannot help listening to thee, go on.""And so, lord of my soul," continued Sancho, as I have said, thisshepherd was in love with Torralva the shepherdess, who was a wildbuxom lass with something of the look of a man about her, for she hadlittle moustaches; I fancy I see her now.""Then you knew her?" said Don Quixote."I did not know her," said Sancho, "but he who told me the story saidit was so true and certain that when I told it to another I mightsafely declare and swear I had seen it all myself. And so in course oftime, the devil, who never sleeps and puts everything in confusion,contrived that the love the shepherd bore the shepherdess turned intohatred and ill-will, and the reason, according to evil tongues, wassome little jealousy she caused him that crossed the line andtrespassed on forbidden ground; and so much did the shepherd hate herfrom that time forward that, in order to escape from her, he determinedto quit the country and go where he should never set eyes on her again.Torralva, when she found herself spurned by Lope, was immediatelysmitten with love for him, though she had never loved him before.""That is the natural way of women," said Don Quixote, "to scorn the onethat loves them, and love the one that hates them: go on, Sancho.""It came to pass," said Sancho, "that the shepherd carried out hisintention, and driving his goats before him took his way across theplains of Estremadura to pass over into the Kingdom of Portugal.Torralva, who knew of it, went after him, and on foot and barefootfollowed him at a distance, with a pilgrim's staff in her hand and ascrip round her neck, in which she carried, it is said, a bit oflooking-glass and a piece of a comb and some little pot or other ofpaint for her face; but let her carry what she did, I am not going totrouble myself to prove it; all I say is, that the shepherd, they say,came with his flock to cross over the river Guadiana, which was at thattime swollen and almost overflowing its banks, and at the spot he cameto there was neither ferry nor boat nor anyone to carry him or hisflock to the other side, at which he was much vexed, for he perceivedthat Torralva was approaching and would give him great annoyance withher tears and entreaties; however, he went looking about so closelythat he discovered a fisherman who had alongside of him a boat so smallthat it could only hold one person and one goat; but for all that hespoke to him and agreed with him to carry himself and his three hundredgoats across. The fisherman got into the boat and carried one goatover; he came back and carried another over; he came back again, andagain brought over another--let your worship keep count of the goats thefisherman is taking across, for if one escapes the memory there will bean end of the story, and it will be impossible to tell another word ofit. To proceed, I must tell you the landing place on the other side wasmiry and slippery, and the fisherman lost a great deal of time in goingand coming; still he returned for another goat, and another, andanother.""Take it for granted he brought them all across," said Don Quixote,"and don't keep going and coming in this way, or thou wilt not make anend of bringing them over this twelvemonth.""How many have gone across so far?" said Sancho."How the devil do I know?" replied Don Quixote."There it is," said Sancho, "what I told you, that you must keep a goodcount; well then, by God, there is an end of the story, for there is nogoing any farther.""How can that be?" said Don Quixote; "is it so essential to the storyto know to a nicety the goats that have crossed over, that if there bea mistake of one in the reckoning, thou canst not go on with it?""No, senor, not a bit," replied Sancho; "for when I asked your worshipto tell me how many goats had crossed, and you answered you did notknow, at that very instant all I had to say passed away out of mymemory, and, faith, there was much virtue in it, and entertainment.""So, then," said Don Quixote, "the story has come to an end?""As much as my mother has," said Sancho."In truth," said Don Quixote, "thou hast told one of the rareststories, tales, or histories, that anyone in the world could haveimagined, and such a way of telling it and ending it was never seen norwill be in a lifetime; though I expected nothing else from thyexcellent understanding. But I do not wonder, for perhaps thoseceaseless strokes may have confused thy wits.""All that may be," replied Sancho, "but I know that as to my story, allthat can be said is that it ends there where the mistake in the countof the passage of the goats begins.""Let it end where it will, well and good," said Don Quixote, "and letus see if Rocinante can go;" and again he spurred him, and againRocinante made jumps and remained where he was, so well tied was he.Just then, whether it was the cold of the morning that was nowapproaching, or that he had eaten something laxative at supper, or thatit was only natural (as is most likely), Sancho felt a desire to dowhat no one could do for him; but so great was the fear that hadpenetrated his heart, he dared not separate himself from his master byas much as the black of his nail; to escape doing what he wanted was,however, also impossible; so what he did for peace's sake was to removehis right hand, which held the back of the saddle, and with it to untiegently and silently the running string which alone held up hisbreeches, so that on loosening it they at once fell down round his feetlike fetters; he then raised his shirt as well as he could and baredhis hind quarters, no slim ones. But, this accomplished, which hefancied was all he had to do to get out of this terrible strait andembarrassment, another still greater difficulty presented itself, forit seemed to him impossible to relieve himself without making somenoise, and he ground his teeth and squeezed his shoulders together,holding his breath as much as he could; but in spite of his precautionshe was unlucky enough after all to make a little noise, very differentfrom that which was causing him so much fear.c19c.jpg (308K)Full SizeDon Quixote, hearing it, said, "What noise is that, Sancho?""I don't know, senor," said he; "it must be something new, foradventures and misadventures never begin with a trifle." Once more hetried his luck, and succeeded so well, that without any further noiseor disturbance he found himself relieved of the burden that had givenhim so much discomfort. But as Don Quixote's sense of smell was asacute as his hearing, and as Sancho was so closely linked with him thatthe fumes rose almost in a straight line, it could not be but that someshould reach his nose, and as soon as they did he came to its relief bycompressing it between his fingers, saying in a rather snuffing tone,"Sancho, it strikes me thou art in great fear.""I am," answered Sancho; "but how does your worship perceive it nowmore than ever?""Because just now thou smellest stronger than ever, and not ofambergris," answered Don Quixote."Very likely," said Sancho, "but that's not my fault, but yourworship's, for leading me about at unseasonable hours and at suchunwonted paces.""Then go back three or four, my friend," said Don Quixote, all the timewith his fingers to his nose; "and for the future pay more attention tothy person and to what thou owest to mine; for it is my greatfamiliarity with thee that has bred this contempt.""I'll bet," replied Sancho, "that your worship thinks I have donesomething I ought not with my person.""It makes it worse to stir it, friend Sancho," returned Don Quixote.With this and other talk of the same sort master and man passed thenight, till Sancho, perceiving that daybreak was coming on apace, verycautiously untied Rocinante and tied up his breeches. As soon asRocinante found himself free, though by nature he was not at allmettlesome, he seemed to feel lively and began pawing--for as tocapering, begging his pardon, he knew not what it meant. Don Quixote,then, observing that Rocinante could move, took it as a good sign and asignal that he should attempt the dread adventure. By this time day hadfully broken and everything showed distinctly, and Don Quixote saw thathe was among some tall trees, chestnuts, which cast a very deep shade;he perceived likewise that the sound of the strokes did not cease, butcould not discover what caused it, and so without any further delay helet Rocinante feel the spur, and once more taking leave of Sancho, hetold him to wait for him there three days at most, as he had saidbefore, and if he should not have returned by that time, he might feelsure it had been God's will that he should end his days in thatperilous adventure. He again repeated the message and commission withwhich he was to go on his behalf to his lady Dulcinea, and said he wasnot to be uneasy as to the payment of his services, for before leavinghome he had made his will, in which he would find himself fullyrecompensed in the matter of wages in due proportion to the time he hadserved; but if God delivered him safe, sound, and unhurt out of thatdanger, he might look upon the promised island as much more thancertain. Sancho began to weep afresh on again hearing the affectingwords of his good master, and resolved to stay with him until the finalissue and end of the business. From these tears and this honourableresolve of Sancho Panza's the author of this history infers that hemust have been of good birth and at least an old Christian; and thefeeling he displayed touched his but not so much as to make him showany weakness; on the contrary, hiding what he felt as well as he could,he began to move towards that quarter whence the sound of the water andof the strokes seemed to come.Sancho followed him on foot, leading by the halter, as his custom was,his ass, his constant comrade in prosperity or adversity; and advancingsome distance through the shady chestnut trees they came upon a littlemeadow at the foot of some high rocks, down which a mighty rush ofwater flung itself. At the foot of the rocks were some rudelyconstructed houses looking more like ruins than houses, from amongwhich came, they perceived, the din and clatter of blows, which stillcontinued without intermission. Rocinante took fright at the noise ofthe water and of the blows, but quieting him Don Quixote advanced stepby step towards the houses, commending himself with all his heart tohis lady, imploring her support in that dread pass and enterprise, andon the way commending himself to God, too, not to forget him. Sanchowho never quitted his side, stretched his neck as far as he could andpeered between the legs of Rocinante to see if he could now discoverwhat it was that caused him such fear and apprehension. They went itmight be a hundred paces farther, when on turning a corner the truecause, beyond the possibility of any mistake, of that dread-soundingand to them awe-inspiring noise that had kept them all the night insuch fear and perplexity, appeared plain and obvious; and it was (if,reader, thou art not disgusted and disappointed) six fulling hammerswhich by their alternate strokes made all the din.When Don Quixote perceived what it was, he was struck dumb and rigidfrom head to foot. Sancho glanced at him and saw him with his head bentdown upon his breast in manifest mortification; and Don Quixote glancedat Sancho and saw him with his cheeks puffed out and his mouth full oflaughter, and evidently ready to explode with it, and in spite of hisvexation he could not help laughing at the sight of him; and whenSancho saw his master begin he let go so heartily that he had to holdhis sides with both hands to keep himself from bursting with laughter.Four times he stopped, and as many times did his laughter break outafresh with the same violence as at first, whereat Don Quixote grewfurious, above all when he heard him say mockingly, "Thou must know,friend Sancho, that of Heaven's will I was born in this our iron age torevive in it the golden or age of gold; I am he for whom are reservedperils, mighty achievements, valiant deeds;" and here he went onrepeating the words that Don Quixote uttered the first time they heardthe awful strokes.Don Quixote, then, seeing that Sancho was turning him into ridicule,was so mortified and vexed that he lifted up his pike and smote him twosuch blows that if, instead of catching them on his shoulders, he hadcaught them on his head there would have been no wages to pay, unlessindeed to his heirs. Sancho seeing that he was getting an awkwardreturn in earnest for his jest, and fearing his master might carry itstill further, said to him very humbly, "Calm yourself, sir, for by GodI am only joking.""Well, then, if you are joking I am not," replied Don Quixote. "Lookhere, my lively gentleman, if these, instead of being fulling hammers,had been some perilous adventure, have I not, think you, shown thecourage required for the attempt and achievement? Am I, perchance,being, as I am, a gentleman, bound to know and distinguish sounds andtell whether they come from fulling mills or not; and that, whenperhaps, as is the case, I have never in my life seen any as you have,low boor as you are, that have been born and bred among them? But turnme these six hammers into six giants, and bring them to beard me, oneby one or all together, and if I do not knock them head over heels,then make what mockery you like of me.""No more of that, senor," returned Sancho; "I own I went a little toofar with the joke. But tell me, your worship, now that peace is madebetween us (and may God bring you out of all the adventures that maybefall you as safe and sound as he has brought you out of this one),was it not a thing to laugh at, and is it not a good story, the greatfear we were in?--at least that I was in; for as to your worship I seenow that you neither know nor understand what either fear or dismayis.""I do not deny," said Don Quixote, "that what happened to us may beworth laughing at, but it is not worth making a story about, for it isnot everyone that is shrewd enough to hit the right point of a thing.""At any rate," said Sancho, "your worship knew how to hit the rightpoint with your pike, aiming at my head and hitting me on theshoulders, thanks be to God and my own smartness in dodging it. But letthat pass; all will come out in the scouring; for I have heard say 'heloves thee well that makes thee weep;' and moreover that it is the waywith great lords after any hard words they give a servant to give him apair of breeches; though I do not know what they give after blows,unless it be that knights-errant after blows give islands, or kingdomson the mainland.""It may be on the dice," said Don Quixote, "that all thou sayest willcome true; overlook the past, for thou art shrewd enough to know thatour first movements are not in our own control; and one thing for thefuture bear in mind, that thou curb and restrain thy loquacity in mycompany; for in all the books of chivalry that I have read, and theyare innumerable, I never met with a squire who talked so much to hislord as thou dost to thine; and in fact I feel it to be a great faultof thine and of mine: of thine, that thou hast so little respect forme; of mine, that I do not make myself more respected. There wasGandalin, the squire of Amadis of Gaul, that was Count of the InsulaFirme, and we read of him that he always addressed his lord with hiscap in his hand, his head bowed down and his body bent double, moreturquesco. And then, what shall we say of Gasabal, the squire ofGalaor, who was so silent that in order to indicate to us the greatnessof his marvellous taciturnity his name is only once mentioned in thewhole of that history, as long as it is truthful? From all I have saidthou wilt gather, Sancho, that there must be a difference betweenmaster and man, between lord and lackey, between knight and squire: sothat from this day forward in our intercourse we must observe morerespect and take less liberties, for in whatever way I may be provokedwith you it will be bad for the pitcher. The favours and benefits thatI have promised you will come in due time, and if they do not yourwages at least will not be lost, as I have already told you.""All that your worship says is very well," said Sancho, "but I shouldlike to know (in case the time of favours should not come, and it mightbe necessary to fall back upon wages) how much did the squire of aknight-errant get in those days, and did they agree by the month, or bythe day like bricklayers?""I do not believe," replied Don Quixote, "that such squires were everon wages, but were dependent on favour; and if I have now mentionedthine in the sealed will I have left at home, it was with a view towhat may happen; for as yet I know not how chivalry will turn out inthese wretched times of ours, and I do not wish my soul to suffer fortrifles in the other world; for I would have thee know, Sancho, that inthis there is no condition more hazardous than that of adventurers.""That is true," said Sancho, "since the mere noise of the hammers of afulling mill can disturb and disquiet the heart of such a valianterrant adventurer as your worship; but you may be sure I will not openmy lips henceforward to make light of anything of your worship's, butonly to honour you as my master and natural lord.""By so doing," replied Don Quixote, "shalt thou live long on the faceof the earth; for next to parents, masters are to be respected asthough they were parents."c19e.jpg (33K)CHAPTER XXI.WHICH TREATS OF THE EXALTED ADVENTURE AND RICH PRIZE OF MAMBRINO'SHELMET, TOGETHER WITH OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO OUR INVINCIBLEKNIGHTc20a.jpg (73K)Full SizeIt now began to rain a little, and Sancho was for going into thefulling mills, but Don Quixote had taken such an abhorrence to them onaccount of the late joke that he would not enter them on any account;so turning aside to right they came upon another road, different fromthat which they had taken the night before. Shortly afterwards DonQuixote perceived a man on horseback who wore on his head somethingthat shone like gold, and the moment he saw him he turned to Sancho andsaid:"I think, Sancho, there is no proverb that is not true, all beingmaxims drawn from experience itself, the mother of all the sciences,especially that one that says, 'Where one door shuts, another opens.' Isay so because if last night fortune shut the door of the adventure wewere looking for against us, cheating us with the fulling mills, it nowopens wide another one for another better and more certain adventure,and if I do not contrive to enter it, it will be my own fault, and Icannot lay it to my ignorance of fulling mills, or the darkness of thenight. I say this because, if I mistake not, there comes towards us onewho wears on his head the helmet of Mambrino, concerning which I tookthe oath thou rememberest.""Mind what you say, your worship, and still more what you do," saidSancho, "for I don't want any more fulling mills to finish off fullingand knocking our senses out.""The devil take thee, man," said Don Quixote; "what has a helmet to dowith fulling mills?""I don't know," replied Sancho, "but, faith, if I might speak as Iused, perhaps I could give such reasons that your worship would see youwere mistaken in what you say.""How can I be mistaken in what I say, unbelieving traitor?" returnedDon Quixote; "tell me, seest thou not yonder knight coming towards uson a dappled grey steed, who has upon his head a helmet of gold?""What I see and make out," answered Sancho, "is only a man on a greyass like my own, who has something that shines on his head.""Well, that is the helmet of Mambrino," said Don Quixote; "stand to oneside and leave me alone with him; thou shalt see how, without saying aword, to save time, I shall bring this adventure to an issue andpossess myself of the helmet I have so longed for.""I will take care to stand aside," said Sancho; "but God grant, I sayonce more, that it may be marjoram and not fulling mills.""I have told thee, brother, on no account to mention those fullingmills to me again," said Don Quixote, "or I vow--and I say no more--I'llfull the soul out of you."Sancho held his peace in dread lest his master should carry out the vowhe had hurled like a bowl at him.The fact of the matter as regards the helmet, steed, and knight thatDon Quixote saw, was this. In that neighbourhood there were twovillages, one of them so small that it had neither apothecary's shopnor barber, which the other that was close to it had, so the barber ofthe larger served the smaller, and in it there was a sick man whorequired to be bled and another man who wanted to be shaved, and onthis errand the barber was going, carrying with him a brass basin; butas luck would have it, as he was on the way it began to rain, and notto spoil his hat, which probably was a new one, he put the basin on hishead, and being clean it glittered at half a league's distance. He rodeupon a grey ass, as Sancho said, and this was what made it seem to DonQuixote to be a dapple-grey steed and a knight and a golden helmet; foreverything he saw he made to fall in with his crazy chivalry andill-errant notions; and when he saw the poor knight draw near, withoutentering into any parley with him, at Rocinante's top speed he boredown upon him with the pike pointed low, fully determined to run himthrough and through, and as he reached him, without checking the furyof his charge, he cried to him:"Defend thyself, miserable being, or yield me of thine own accord thatwhich is so reasonably my due."The barber, who without any expectation or apprehension of it saw thisapparition coming down upon him, had no other way of saving himselffrom the stroke of the lance but to let himself fall off his ass; andno sooner had he touched the ground than he sprang up more nimbly thana deer and sped away across the plain faster than the wind.He left the basin on the ground, with which Don Quixote contentedhimself, saying that the pagan had shown his discretion and imitatedthe beaver, which finding itself pressed by the hunters bites and cutsoff with its teeth that for which, by its natural instinct, it knows itis pursued.He told Sancho to pick up the helmet, and he taking it in his handssaid:"By God the basin is a good one, and worth a real of eight if it isworth a maravedis," and handed it to his master, who immediately put iton his head, turning it round, now this way, now that, in search offitment, and not finding it he said, "Clearly the pagan to whosemeasure this famous head-piece was first forged must have had a verylarge head; but the worst of it is half of it is wanting."When Sancho heard him call the basin a headpiece he was unable torestrain his laughter, but remembering his master's wrath he checkedhimself in the midst of it."What art thou laughing at, Sancho?" said Don Quixote."I am laughing," said he, "to think of the great head the pagan musthave had who owned this helmet, for it looks exactly like a regularbarber's basin.""Dost thou know what I suspect, Sancho?" said Don Quixote; "that thiswonderful piece of this enchanted helmet must by some strange accidenthave come into the hands of someone who was unable to recognise orrealise its value, and who, not knowing what he did, and seeing it tobe of the purest gold, must have melted down one half for the sake ofwhat it might be worth, and of the other made this which is like abarber's basin as thou sayest; but be it as it may, to me who recogniseit, its transformation makes no difference, for I will set it to rightsat the first village where there is a blacksmith, and in such stylethat that helmet the god of smithies forged for the god of battlesshall not surpass it or even come up to it; and in the meantime I willwear it as well as I can, for something is better than nothing; all themore as it will be quite enough to protect me from any chance blow of astone.""That is," said Sancho, "if it is not shot with a sling as they were inthe battle of the two armies, when they signed the cross on yourworship's grinders and smashed the flask with that blessed draught thatmade me vomit my bowels up.""It does not grieve me much to have lost it," said Don Quixote, "forthou knowest, Sancho, that I have the receipt in my memory.""So have I," answered Sancho, "but if ever I make it, or try it againas long as I live, may this be my last hour; moreover, I have nointention of putting myself in the way of wanting it, for I mean, withall my five senses, to keep myself from being wounded or from woundinganyone: as to being blanketed again I say nothing, for it is hard toprevent mishaps of that sort, and if they come there is nothing for itbut to squeeze our shoulders together, hold our breath, shut our eyes,and let ourselves go where luck and the blanket may send us.""Thou art a bad Christian, Sancho," said Don Quixote on hearing this,"for once an injury has been done thee thou never forgettest it: butknow that it is the part of noble and generous hearts not to attachimportance to trifles. What lame leg hast thou got by it, what brokenrib, what cracked head, that thou canst not forget that jest? For jestand sport it was, properly regarded, and had I not seen it in thatlight I would have returned and done more mischief in revenging theethan the Greeks did for the rape of Helen, who, if she were alive now,or if my Dulcinea had lived then, might depend upon it she would not beso famous for her beauty as she is;" and here he heaved a sigh and sentit aloft; and said Sancho, "Let it pass for a jest as it cannot berevenged in earnest, but I know what sort of jest and earnest it was,and I know it will never be rubbed out of my memory any more than offmy shoulders. But putting that aside, will your worship tell me whatare we to do with this dapple-grey steed that looks like a grey ass,which that Martino that your worship overthrew has left deserted here?for, from the way he took to his heels and bolted, he is not likelyever to come back for it; and by my beard but the grey is a good one.""I have never been in the habit," said Don Quixote, "of taking spoil ofthose whom I vanquish, nor is it the practice of chivalry to take awaytheir horses and leave them to go on foot, unless indeed it be that thevictor have lost his own in the combat, in which case it is lawful totake that of the vanquished as a thing won in lawful war; therefore,Sancho, leave this horse, or ass, or whatever thou wilt have it to be;for when its owner sees us gone hence he will come back for it.""God knows I should like to take it," returned Sancho, "or at least tochange it for my own, which does not seem to me as good a one: verilythe laws of chivalry are strict, since they cannot be stretched to letone ass be changed for another; I should like to know if I might atleast change trappings.""On that head I am not quite certain," answered Don Quixote, "and thematter being doubtful, pending better information, I say thou mayestchange them, if so be thou hast urgent need of them.""So urgent is it," answered Sancho, "that if they were for my ownperson I could not want them more;" and forthwith, fortified by thislicence, he effected the _mutatio capparum_, and rigged out his beastto the ninety-nines and making quite another thing of it. This done,they broke their fast on the remains of the spoils of war plunderedfrom the sumpter mule, and drank of the brook that flowed from thefulling mills, without casting a look in that direction, in suchloathing did they hold them for the alarm they had caused them; and,all anger and gloom removed, they mounted and, without taking any fixedroad (not to fix upon any being the proper thing for trueknights-errant), they set out, guided by Rocinante's will, whichcarried along with it that of his master, not to say that of the ass,which always followed him wherever he led, lovingly and sociably;nevertheless they returned to the high road, and pursued it at aventure without any other aim.As they went along, then, in this way Sancho said to his master,"Senor, would your worship give me leave to speak a little to you? Forsince you laid that hard injunction of silence on me several thingshave gone to rot in my stomach, and I have now just one on the tip ofmy tongue that I don't want to be spoiled.""Say, on, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "and be brief in thy discourse,for there is no pleasure in one that is long.""Well then, senor," returned Sancho, "I say that for some days past Ihave been considering how little is got or gained by going in search ofthese adventures that your worship seeks in these wilds andcross-roads, where, even if the most perilous are victoriouslyachieved, there is no one to see or know of them, and so they must beleft untold for ever, to the loss of your worship's object and thecredit they deserve; therefore it seems to me it would be better(saving your worship's better judgment) if we were to go and serve someemperor or other great prince who may have some war on hand, in whoseservice your worship may prove the worth of your person, your greatmight, and greater understanding, on perceiving which the lord in whoseservice we may be will perforce have to reward us, each according tohis merits; and there you will not be at a loss for someone to set downyour achievements in writing so as to preserve their memory for ever.Of my own I say nothing, as they will not go beyond squirely limits,though I make bold to say that, if it be the practice in chivalry towrite the achievements of squires, I think mine must not be left out.""Thou speakest not amiss, Sancho," answered Don Quixote, "but beforethat point is reached it is requisite to roam the world, as it were onprobation, seeking adventures, in order that, by achieving some, nameand fame may be acquired, such that when he betakes himself to thecourt of some great monarch the knight may be already known by hisdeeds, and that the boys, the instant they see him enter the gate ofthe city, may all follow him and surround him, crying, 'This is theKnight of the Sun'--or the Serpent, or any other title under which hemay have achieved great deeds. 'This,' they will say, 'is he whovanquished in single combat the gigantic Brocabruno of mighty strength;he who delivered the great Mameluke of Persia out of the longenchantment under which he had been for almost nine hundred years.' Sofrom one to another they will go proclaiming his achievements; andpresently at the tumult of the boys and the others the king of thatkingdom will appear at the windows of his royal palace, and as soon ashe beholds the knight, recognising him by his arms and the device onhis shield, he will as a matter of course say, 'What ho! Forth all ye,the knights of my court, to receive the flower of chivalry who comethhither!' At which command all will issue forth, and he himself,advancing half-way down the stairs, will embrace him closely, andsalute him, kissing him on the cheek, and will then lead him to thequeen's chamber, where the knight will find her with the princess herdaughter, who will be one of the most beautiful and accomplisheddamsels that could with the utmost pains be discovered anywhere in theknown world. Straightway it will come to pass that she will fix hereyes upon the knight and he his upon her, and each will seem to theother something more divine than human, and, without knowing how or whythey will be taken and entangled in the inextricable toils of love, andsorely distressed in their hearts not to see any way of making theirpains and sufferings known by speech. Thence they will lead him, nodoubt, to some richly adorned chamber of the palace, where, havingremoved his armour, they will bring him a rich mantle of scarletwherewith to robe himself, and if he looked noble in his armour he willlook still more so in a doublet. When night comes he will sup with theking, queen, and princess; and all the time he will never take his eyesoff her, stealing stealthy glances, unnoticed by those present, and shewill do the same, and with equal cautiousness, being, as I have said, adamsel of great discretion. The tables being removed, suddenly throughthe door of the hall there will enter a hideous and diminutive dwarffollowed by a fair dame, between two giants, who comes with a certainadventure, the work of an ancient sage; and he who shall achieve itshall be deemed the best knight in the world."The king will then command all those present to essay it, and nonewill bring it to an end and conclusion save the stranger knight, to thegreat enhancement of his fame, whereat the princess will be overjoyedand will esteem herself happy and fortunate in having fixed and placedher thoughts so high. And the best of it is that this king, or prince,or whatever he is, is engaged in a very bitter war with another aspowerful as himself, and the stranger knight, after having been somedays at his court, requests leave from him to go and serve him in thesaid war. The king will grant it very readily, and the knight willcourteously kiss his hands for the favour done to him; and that nighthe will take leave of his lady the princess at the grating of thechamber where she sleeps, which looks upon a garden, and at which hehas already many times conversed with her, the go-between andconfidante in the matter being a damsel much trusted by the princess.He will sigh, she will swoon, the damsel will fetch water, muchdistressed because morning approaches, and for the honour of her ladyhe would not that they were discovered; at last the princess will cometo herself and will present her white hands through the grating to theknight, who will kiss them a thousand and a thousand times, bathingthem with his tears. It will be arranged between them how they are toinform each other of their good or evil fortunes, and the princess willentreat him to make his absence as short as possible, which he willpromise to do with many oaths; once more he kisses her hands, and takeshis leave in such grief that he is well-nigh ready to die. He betakeshim thence to his chamber, flings himself on his bed, cannot sleep forsorrow at parting, rises early in the morning, goes to take leave ofthe king, queen, and princess, and, as he takes his leave of the pair,it is told him that the princess is indisposed and cannot receive avisit; the knight thinks it is from grief at his departure, his heartis pierced, and he is hardly able to keep from showing his pain. Theconfidante is present, observes all, goes to tell her mistress, wholistens with tears and says that one of her greatest distresses is notknowing who this knight is, and whether he is of kingly lineage or not;the damsel assures her that so much courtesy, gentleness, and gallantryof bearing as her knight possesses could not exist in any save one whowas royal and illustrious; her anxiety is thus relieved, and shestrives to be of good cheer lest she should excite suspicion in herparents, and at the end of two days she appears in public. Meanwhilethe knight has taken his departure; he fights in the war, conquers theking's enemy, wins many cities, triumphs in many battles, returns tothe court, sees his lady where he was wont to see her, and it is agreedthat he shall demand her in marriage of her parents as the reward ofhis services; the king is unwilling to give her, as he knows not who heis, but nevertheless, whether carried off or in whatever other way itmay be, the princess comes to be his bride, and her father comes toregard it as very good fortune; for it so happens that this knight isproved to be the son of a valiant king of some kingdom, I know notwhat, for I fancy it is not likely to be on the map. The father dies,the princess inherits, and in two words the knight becomes king. Andhere comes in at once the bestowal of rewards upon his squire and allwho have aided him in rising to so exalted a rank. He marries hissquire to a damsel of the princess's, who will be, no doubt, the onewho was confidante in their amour, and is daughter of a very greatduke.""That's what I want, and no mistake about it!" said Sancho. "That'swhat I'm waiting for; for all this, word for word, is in store for yourworship under the title of the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.""Thou needst not doubt it, Sancho," replied Don Quixote, "for in thesame manner, and by the same steps as I have described here,knights-errant rise and have risen to be kings and emperors; all wewant now is to find out what king, Christian or pagan, is at war andhas a beautiful daughter; but there will be time enough to think ofthat, for, as I have told thee, fame must be won in other quartersbefore repairing to the court. There is another thing, too, that iswanting; for supposing we find a king who is at war and has a beautifuldaughter, and that I have won incredible fame throughout the universe,I know not how it can be made out that I am of royal lineage, or evensecond cousin to an emperor; for the king will not be willing to giveme his daughter in marriage unless he is first thoroughly satisfied onthis point, however much my famous deeds may deserve it; so that bythis deficiency I fear I shall lose what my arm has fairly earned. Trueit is I am a gentleman of known house, of estate and property, andentitled to the five hundred sueldos mulet; and it may be that the sagewho shall write my history will so clear up my ancestry and pedigreethat I may find myself fifth or sixth in descent from a king; for Iwould have thee know, Sancho, that there are two kinds of lineages inthe world; some there be tracing and deriving their descent from kingsand princes, whom time has reduced little by little until they end in apoint like a pyramid upside down; and others who spring from the commonherd and go on rising step by step until they come to be great lords;so that the difference is that the one were what they no longer are,and the others are what they formerly were not. And I may be of suchthat after investigation my origin may prove great and famous, withwhich the king, my father-in-law that is to be, ought to be satisfied;and should he not be, the princess will so love me that even though shewell knew me to be the son of a water-carrier, she will take me for herlord and husband in spite of her father; if not, then it comes toseizing her and carrying her off where I please; for time or death willput an end to the wrath of her parents.""It comes to this, too," said Sancho, "what some naughty people say,'Never ask as a favour what thou canst take by force;' though it wouldfit better to say, 'A clear escape is better than good men's prayers.'I say so because if my lord the king, your worship's father-in-law,will not condescend to give you my lady the princess, there is nothingfor it but, as your worship says, to seize her and transport her. Butthe mischief is that until peace is made and you come into the peacefulenjoyment of your kingdom, the poor squire is famishing as far asrewards go, unless it be that the confidante damsel that is to be hiswife comes with the princess, and that with her he tides over his badluck until Heaven otherwise orders things; for his master, I suppose,may as well give her to him at once for a lawful wife.""Nobody can object to that," said Don Quixote."Then since that may be," said Sancho, "there is nothing for it but tocommend ourselves to God, and let fortune take what course it will.""God guide it according to my wishes and thy wants," said Don Quixote,"and mean be he who thinks himself mean.""In God's name let him be so," said Sancho: "I am an old Christian, andto fit me for a count that's enough.""And more than enough for thee," said Don Quixote; "and even wert thounot, it would make no difference, because I being the king can easilygive thee nobility without purchase or service rendered by thee, forwhen I make thee a count, then thou art at once a gentleman; and theymay say what they will, but by my faith they will have to call thee'your lordship,' whether they like it or not.""Not a doubt of it; and I'll know how to support the tittle," saidSancho."Title thou shouldst say, not tittle," said his master."So be it," answered Sancho. "I say I will know how to behave, for oncein my life I was beadle of a brotherhood, and the beadle's gown sat sowell on me that all said I looked as if I was to be steward of the samebrotherhood. What will it be, then, when I put a duke's robe on myback, or dress myself in gold and pearls like a count? I believethey'll come a hundred leagues to see me.""Thou wilt look well," said Don Quixote, "but thou must shave thy beardoften, for thou hast it so thick and rough and unkempt, that if thoudost not shave it every second day at least, they will see what thouart at the distance of a musket shot.""What more will it be," said Sancho, "than having a barber, and keepinghim at wages in the house? and even if it be necessary, I will make himgo behind me like a nobleman's equerry.""Why, how dost thou know that noblemen have equerries behind them?"asked Don Quixote."I will tell you," answered Sancho. "Years ago I was for a month at thecapital and there I saw taking the air a very small gentleman who theysaid was a very great man, and a man following him on horseback inevery turn he took, just as if he was his tail. I asked why this mandid not join the other man, instead of always going behind him; theyanswered me that he was his equerry, and that it was the custom withnobles to have such persons behind them, and ever since then I know it,for I have never forgotten it.""Thou art right," said Don Quixote, "and in the same way thou mayestcarry thy barber with thee, for customs did not come into use alltogether, nor were they all invented at once, and thou mayest be thefirst count to have a barber to follow him; and, indeed, shaving one'sbeard is a greater trust than saddling one's horse.""Let the barber business be my look-out," said Sancho; "and yourworship's be it to strive to become a king, and make me a count.""So it shall be," answered Don Quixote, and raising his eyes he sawwhat will be told in the following chapter.c20e.jpg (18K)CHAPTER XXII.OF THE FREEDOM DON QUIXOTE CONFERRED ON SEVERAL UNFORTUNATES WHOAGAINST THEIR WILL WERE BEING CARRIED WHERE THEY HAD NO WISH TO GOc22a.jpg (178K)Full SizeCid Hamete Benengeli, the Arab and Manchegan author, relates in thismost grave, high-sounding, minute, delightful, and original historythat after the discussion between the famous Don Quixote of La Manchaand his squire Sancho Panza which is set down at the end of chaptertwenty-one, Don Quixote raised his eyes and saw coming along the roadhe was following some dozen men on foot strung together by the neck,like beads, on a great iron chain, and all with manacles on theirhands. With them there came also two men on horseback and two on foot;those on horseback with wheel-lock muskets, those on foot with javelinsand swords, and as soon as Sancho saw them he said:"That is a chain of galley slaves, on the way to the galleys by forceof the king's orders.""How by force?" asked Don Quixote; "is it possible that the king usesforce against anyone?""I do not say that," answered Sancho, "but that these are peoplecondemned for their crimes to serve by force in the king's galleys.""In fact," replied Don Quixote, "however it may be, these people aregoing where they are taking them by force, and not of their own will.""Just so," said Sancho."Then if so," said Don Quixote, "here is a case for the exercise of myoffice, to put down force and to succour and help the wretched.""Recollect, your worship," said Sancho, "Justice, which is the kinghimself, is not using force or doing wrong to such persons, butpunishing them for their crimes."The chain of galley slaves had by this time come up, and Don Quixote invery courteous language asked those who were in custody of it to begood enough to tell him the reason or reasons for which they wereconducting these people in this manner. One of the guards on horsebackanswered that they were galley slaves belonging to his majesty, thatthey were going to the galleys, and that was all that was to be saidand all he had any business to know.c22b.jpg (298K)Full Size"Nevertheless," replied Don Quixote, "I should like to know from eachof them separately the reason of his misfortune;" to this he added moreto the same effect to induce them to tell him what he wanted so civillythat the other mounted guard said to him:"Though we have here the register and certificate of the sentence ofevery one of these wretches, this is no time to take them out or readthem; come and ask themselves; they can tell if they choose, and theywill, for these fellows take a pleasure in doing and talking aboutrascalities."With this permission, which Don Quixote would have taken even had theynot granted it, he approached the chain and asked the first for whatoffences he was now in such a sorry case.He made answer that it was for being a lover."For that only?" replied Don Quixote; "why, if for being lovers theysend people to the galleys I might have been rowing in them long ago.""The love is not the sort your worship is thinking of," said the galleyslave; "mine was that I loved a washerwoman's basket of clean linen sowell, and held it so close in my embrace, that if the arm of the lawhad not forced it from me, I should never have let it go of my own willto this moment; I was caught in the act, there was no occasion fortorture, the case was settled, they treated me to a hundred lashes onthe back, and three years of gurapas besides, and that was the end ofit.""What are gurapas?" asked Don Quixote."Gurapas are galleys," answered the galley slave, who was a young manof about four-and-twenty, and said he was a native of Piedrahita.Don Quixote asked the same question of the second, who made no reply,so downcast and melancholy was he; but the first answered for him, andsaid, "He, sir, goes as a canary, I mean as a musician and a singer.""What!" said Don Quixote, "for being musicians and singers are peoplesent to the galleys too?""Yes, sir," answered the galley slave, "for there is nothing worse thansinging under suffering.""On the contrary, I have heard say," said Don Quixote, "that he whosings scares away his woes.""Here it is the reverse," said the galley slave; "for he who sings onceweeps all his life.""I do not understand it," said Don Quixote; but one of the guards saidto him, "Sir, to sing under suffering means with the _non sancta_fraternity to confess under torture; they put this sinner to thetorture and he confessed his crime, which was being a cuatrero, that isa cattle-stealer, and on his confession they sentenced him to six yearsin the galleys, besides two hundred lashes that he has already had onthe back; and he is always dejected and downcast because the otherthieves that were left behind and that march here ill-treat, and snub,and jeer, and despise him for confessing and not having spirit enoughto say nay; for, say they, 'nay' has no more letters in it than 'yea,'and a culprit is well off when life or death with him depends on hisown tongue and not on that of witnesses or evidence; and to my thinkingthey are not very far out.""And I think so too," answered Don Quixote; then passing on to thethird he asked him what he had asked the others, and the man answeredvery readily and unconcernedly, "I am going for five years to theirladyships the gurapas for the want of ten ducats.""I will give twenty with pleasure to get you out of that trouble," saidDon Quixote."That," said the galley slave, "is like a man having money at sea whenhe is dying of hunger and has no way of buying what he wants; I say sobecause if at the right time I had had those twenty ducats that yourworship now offers me, I would have greased the notary's pen andfreshened up the attorney's wit with them, so that to-day I should bein the middle of the plaza of the Zocodover at Toledo, and not on thisroad coupled like a greyhound. But God is great; patience--there, that'senough of it."Don Quixote passed on to the fourth, a man of venerable aspect with awhite beard falling below his breast, who on hearing himself asked thereason of his being there began to weep without answering a word, butthe fifth acted as his tongue and said, "This worthy man is going tothe galleys for four years, after having gone the rounds in ceremonyand on horseback.""That means," said Sancho Panza, "as I take it, to have been exposed toshame in public.""Just so," replied the galley slave, "and the offence for which theygave him that punishment was having been an ear-broker, naybody-broker; I mean, in short, that this gentleman goes as a pimp, andfor having besides a certain touch of the sorcerer about him.""If that touch had not been thrown in," said Don Quixote, "he would notdeserve, for mere pimping, to row in the galleys, but rather to commandand be admiral of them; for the office of pimp is no ordinary one,being the office of persons of discretion, one very necessary in awell-ordered state, and only to be exercised by persons of good birth;nay, there ought to be an inspector and overseer of them, as in otheroffices, and recognised number, as with the brokers on change; in thisway many of the evils would be avoided which are caused by this officeand calling being in the hands of stupid and ignorant people, such aswomen more or less silly, and pages and jesters of little standing andexperience, who on the most urgent occasions, and when ingenuity ofcontrivance is needed, let the crumbs freeze on the way to theirmouths, and know not which is their right hand. I should like to gofarther, and give reasons to show that it is advisable to choose thosewho are to hold so necessary an office in the state, but this is notthe fit place for it; some day I will expound the matter to someoneable to see to and rectify it; all I say now is, that the additionalfact of his being a sorcerer has removed the sorrow it gave me to seethese white hairs and this venerable countenance in so painful aposition on account of his being a pimp; though I know well there areno sorceries in the world that can move or compel the will as somesimple folk fancy, for our will is free, nor is there herb or charmthat can force it. All that certain silly women and quacks do is toturn men mad with potions and poisons, pretending that they have powerto cause love, for, as I say, it is an impossibility to compel thewill.""It is true," said the good old man, "and indeed, sir, as far as thecharge of sorcery goes I was not guilty; as to that of being a pimp Icannot deny it; but I never thought I was doing any harm by it, for myonly object was that all the world should enjoy itself and live inpeace and quiet, without quarrels or troubles; but my good intentionswere unavailing to save me from going where I never expect to come backfrom, with this weight of years upon me and a urinary ailment thatnever gives me a moment's ease;" and again he fell to weeping asbefore, and such compassion did Sancho feel for him that he took out areal of four from his bosom and gave it to him in alms.Don Quixote went on and asked another what his crime was, and the mananswered with no less but rather much more sprightliness than the lastone."I am here because I carried the joke too far with a couple of cousinsof mine, and with a couple of other cousins who were none of mine; inshort, I carried the joke so far with them all that it ended in such acomplicated increase of kindred that no accountant could make it clear:it was all proved against me, I got no favour, I had no money, I wasnear having my neck stretched, they sentenced me to the galleys for sixyears, I accepted my fate, it is the punishment of my fault; I am ayoung man; let life only last, and with that all will come right. Ifyou, sir, have anything wherewith to help the poor, God will repay itto you in heaven, and we on earth will take care in our petitions tohim to pray for the life and health of your worship, that they may beas long and as good as your amiable appearance deserves."This one was in the dress of a student, and one of the guards said hewas a great talker and a very elegant Latin scholar.Behind all these there came a man of thirty, a very personable fellow,except that when he looked, his eyes turned in a little one towards theother. He was bound differently from the rest, for he had to his leg achain so long that it was wound all round his body, and two rings onhis neck, one attached to the chain, the other to what they call a"keep-friend" or "friend's foot," from which hung two irons reaching tohis waist with two manacles fixed to them in which his hands weresecured by a big padlock, so that he could neither raise his hands tohis mouth nor lower his head to his hands. Don Quixote asked why thisman carried so many more chains than the others. The guard replied thatit was because he alone had committed more crimes than all the rest puttogether, and was so daring and such a villain, that though theymarched him in that fashion they did not feel sure of him, but were indread of his making his escape."What crimes can he have committed," said Don Quixote, "if they havenot deserved a heavier punishment than being sent to the galleys?""He goes for ten years," replied the guard, "which is the same thing ascivil death, and all that need be said is that this good fellow is thefamous Gines de Pasamonte, otherwise called Ginesillo de Parapilla.""Gently, senor commissary," said the galley slave at this, "let us haveno fixing of names or surnames; my name is Gines, not Ginesillo, and myfamily name is Pasamonte, not Parapilla as you say; let each one mindhis own business, and he will be doing enough.""Speak with less impertinence, master thief of extra measure," repliedthe commissary, "if you don't want me to make you hold your tongue inspite of your teeth.""It is easy to see," returned the galley slave, "that man goes as Godpleases, but someone shall know some day whether I am called Ginesillode Parapilla or not.""Don't they call you so, you liar?" said the guard."They do," returned Gines, "but I will make them give over calling meso, or I will be shaved, where, I only say behind my teeth. If you,sir, have anything to give us, give it to us at once, and God speedyou, for you are becoming tiresome with all this inquisitiveness aboutthe lives of others; if you want to know about mine, let me tell you Iam Gines de Pasamonte, whose life is written by these fingers.""He says true," said the commissary, "for he has himself written hisstory as grand as you please, and has left the book in the prison inpawn for two hundred reals.""And I mean to take it out of pawn," said Gines, "though it were in fortwo hundred ducats.""Is it so good?" said Don Quixote."So good is it," replied Gines, "that a fig for 'Lazarillo de Tormes,'and all of that kind that have been written, or shall be writtencompared with it: all I will say about it is that it deals with facts,and facts so neat and diverting that no lies could match them.""And how is the book entitled?" asked Don Quixote."The 'Life of Gines de Pasamonte,'" replied the subject of it."And is it finished?" asked Don Quixote."How can it be finished," said the other, "when my life is not yetfinished? All that is written is from my birth down to the point whenthey sent me to the galleys this last time.""Then you have been there before?" said Don Quixote."In the service of God and the king I have been there for four yearsbefore now, and I know by this time what the biscuit and courbash arelike," replied Gines; "and it is no great grievance to me to go back tothem, for there I shall have time to finish my book; I have still manythings left to say, and in the galleys of Spain there is more thanenough leisure; though I do not want much for what I have to write, forI have it by heart.""You seem a clever fellow," said Don Quixote."And an unfortunate one," replied Gines, "for misfortune alwayspersecutes good wit.""It persecutes rogues," said the commissary."I told you already to go gently, master commissary," said Pasamonte;"their lordships yonder never gave you that staff to ill-treat uswretches here, but to conduct and take us where his majesty orders you;if not, by the life of--never mind--; it may be that some day the stainsmade in the inn will come out in the scouring; let everyone hold histongue and behave well and speak better; and now let us march on, forwe have had quite enough of this entertainment."The commissary lifted his staff to strike Pasamonte in return for histhreats, but Don Quixote came between them, and begged him not toill-use him, as it was not too much to allow one who had his hands tiedto have his tongue a trifle free; and turning to the whole chain ofthem he said:"From all you have told me, dear brethren, I make out clearly thatthough they have punished you for your faults, the punishments you areabout to endure do not give you much pleasure, and that you go to themvery much against the grain and against your will, and that perhapsthis one's want of courage under torture, that one's want of money, theother's want of advocacy, and lastly the perverted judgment of thejudge may have been the cause of your ruin and of your failure toobtain the justice you had on your side. All which presents itself nowto my mind, urging, persuading, and even compelling me to demonstratein your case the purpose for which Heaven sent me into the world andcaused me to make profession of the order of chivalry to which Ibelong, and the vow I took therein to give aid to those in need andunder the oppression of the strong. But as I know that it is a mark ofprudence not to do by foul means what may be done by fair, I will askthese gentlemen, the guards and commissary, to be so good as to releaseyou and let you go in peace, as there will be no lack of others toserve the king under more favourable circumstances; for it seems to mea hard case to make slaves of those whom God and nature have made free.Moreover, sirs of the guard," added Don Quixote, "these poor fellowshave done nothing to you; let each answer for his own sins yonder;there is a God in Heaven who will not forget to punish the wicked orreward the good; and it is not fitting that honest men should be theinstruments of punishment to others, they being therein no wayconcerned. This request I make thus gently and quietly, that, if youcomply with it, I may have reason for thanking you; and, if you willnot voluntarily, this lance and sword together with the might of my armshall compel you to comply with it by force.""Nice nonsense!" said the commissary; "a fine piece of pleasantry hehas come out with at last! He wants us to let the king's prisoners go,as if we had any authority to release them, or he to order us to do so!Go your way, sir, and good luck to you; put that basin straight thatyou've got on your head, and don't go looking for three feet on a cat.""'Tis you that are the cat, rat, and rascal," replied Don Quixote, andacting on the word he fell upon him so suddenly that without giving himtime to defend himself he brought him to the ground sorely wounded witha lance-thrust; and lucky it was for him that it was the one that hadthe musket. The other guards stood thunderstruck and amazed at thisunexpected event, but recovering presence of mind, those on horsebackseized their swords, and those on foot their javelins, and attacked DonQuixote, who was waiting for them with great calmness; and no doubt itwould have gone badly with him if the galley slaves, seeing the chancebefore them of liberating themselves, had not effected it by contrivingto break the chain on which they were strung. Such was the confusion,that the guards, now rushing at the galley slaves who were breakingloose, now to attack Don Quixote who was waiting for them, did nothingat all that was of any use. Sancho, on his part, gave a helping hand torelease Gines de Pasamonte, who was the first to leap forth upon theplain free and unfettered, and who, attacking the prostrate commissary,took from him his sword and the musket, with which, aiming at one andlevelling at another, he, without ever discharging it, drove every oneof the guards off the field, for they took to flight, as well to escapePasamonte's musket, as the showers of stones the now released galleyslaves were raining upon them. Sancho was greatly grieved at theaffair, because he anticipated that those who had fled would report thematter to the Holy Brotherhood, who at the summons of the alarm-bellwould at once sally forth in quest of the offenders; and he said so tohis master, and entreated him to leave the place at once, and go intohiding in the sierra that was close by."That is all very well," said Don Quixote, "but I know what must bedone now;" and calling together all the galley slaves, who were nowrunning riot, and had stripped the commissary to the skin, he collectedthem round him to hear what he had to say, and addressed them asfollows: "To be grateful for benefits received is the part of personsof good birth, and one of the sins most offensive to God isingratitude; I say so because, sirs, ye have already seen by manifestproof the benefit ye have received of me; in return for which I desire,and it is my good pleasure that, laden with that chain which I havetaken off your necks, ye at once set out and proceed to the city of ElToboso, and there present yourselves before the lady Dulcinea delToboso, and say to her that her knight, he of the Rueful Countenance,sends to commend himself to her; and that ye recount to her in fulldetail all the particulars of this notable adventure, up to therecovery of your longed-for liberty; and this done ye may go where yewill, and good fortune attend you."Gines de Pasamonte made answer for all, saying, "That which you, sir,our deliverer, demand of us, is of all impossibilities the mostimpossible to comply with, because we cannot go together along theroads, but only singly and separate, and each one his own way,endeavouring to hide ourselves in the bowels of the earth to escape theHoly Brotherhood, which, no doubt, will come out in search of us. Whatyour worship may do, and fairly do, is to change this service andtribute as regards the lady Dulcinea del Toboso for a certain quantityof ave-marias and credos which we will say for your worship'sintention, and this is a condition that can be complied with by nightas by day, running or resting, in peace or in war; but to imagine thatwe are going now to return to the flesh-pots of Egypt, I mean to takeup our chain and set out for El Toboso, is to imagine that it is nownight, though it is not yet ten in the morning, and to ask this of usis like asking pears of the elm tree.""Then by all that's good," said Don Quixote (now stirred to wrath),"Don son of a bitch, Don Ginesillo de Paropillo, or whatever your nameis, you will have to go yourself alone, with your tail between yourlegs and the whole chain on your back."Pasamonte, who was anything but meek (being by this time thoroughlyconvinced that Don Quixote was not quite right in his head as he hadcommitted such a vagary as to set them free), finding himself abused inthis fashion, gave the wink to his companions, and falling back theybegan to shower stones on Don Quixote at such a rate that he was quiteunable to protect himself with his buckler, and poor Rocinante no moreheeded the spur than if he had been made of brass. Sancho plantedhimself behind his ass, and with him sheltered himself from thehailstorm that poured on both of them. Don Quixote was unable to shieldhimself so well but that more pebbles than I could count struck himfull on the body with such force that they brought him to the ground;and the instant he fell the student pounced upon him, snatched thebasin from his head, and with it struck three or four blows on hisshoulders, and as many more on the ground, knocking it almost topieces. They then stripped him of a jacket that he wore over hisarmour, and they would have stripped off his stockings if his greaveshad not prevented them. From Sancho they took his coat, leaving him inhis shirt-sleeves; and dividing among themselves the remaining spoilsof the battle, they went each one his own way, more solicitous aboutkeeping clear of the Holy Brotherhood they dreaded, than aboutburdening themselves with the chain, or going to present themselvesbefore the lady Dulcinea del Toboso. The ass and Rocinante, Sancho andDon Quixote, were all that were left upon the spot; the ass withdrooping head, serious, shaking his ears from time to time as if hethought the storm of stones that assailed them was not yet over;Rocinante stretched beside his master, for he too had been brought tothe ground by a stone; Sancho stripped, and trembling with fear of theHoly Brotherhood; and Don Quixote fuming to find himself so served bythe very persons for whom he had done so much.c22e.jpg (44K)CHAPTER XXIII.OF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE IN THE SIERRA MORENA, WHICH WAS ONE OF THERAREST ADVENTURES RELATED IN THIS VERACIOUS HISTORYc23a.jpg (148K)Full SizeSeeing himself served in this way, Don Quixote said to his squire, "Ihave always heard it said, Sancho, that to do good to boors is to throwwater into the sea. If I had believed thy words, I should have avoidedthis trouble; but it is done now, it is only to have patience and takewarning for the future."c23b.jpg (318K)Full Size"Your worship will take warning as much as I am a Turk," returnedSancho; "but, as you say this mischief might have been avoided if youhad believed me, believe me now, and a still greater one will beavoided; for I tell you chivalry is of no account with the HolyBrotherhood, and they don't care two maravedis for all theknights-errant in the world; and I can tell you I fancy I hear theirarrows whistling past my ears this minute.""Thou art a coward by nature, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "but lest thoushouldst say I am obstinate, and that I never do as thou dost advise,this once I will take thy advice, and withdraw out of reach of thatfury thou so dreadest; but it must be on one condition, that never, inlife or in death, thou art to say to anyone that I retired or withdrewfrom this danger out of fear, but only in compliance with thyentreaties; for if thou sayest otherwise thou wilt lie therein, andfrom this time to that, and from that to this, I give thee lie, and saythou liest and wilt lie every time thou thinkest or sayest it; andanswer me not again; for at the mere thought that I am withdrawing orretiring from any danger, above all from this, which does seem to carrysome little shadow of fear with it, I am ready to take my stand hereand await alone, not only that Holy Brotherhood you talk of and dread,but the brothers of the twelve tribes of Israel, and the SevenMaccabees, and Castor and Pollux, and all the brothers and brotherhoodsin the world.""Senor," replied Sancho, "to retire is not to flee, and there is nowisdom in waiting when danger outweighs hope, and it is the part ofwise men to preserve themselves to-day for to-morrow, and not risk allin one day; and let me tell you, though I am a clown and a boor, I havegot some notion of what they call safe conduct; so repent not of havingtaken my advice, but mount Rocinante if you can, and if not I will helpyou; and follow me, for my mother-wit tells me we have more need oflegs than hands just now."Don Quixote mounted without replying, and, Sancho leading the way onhis ass, they entered the side of the Sierra Morena, which was closeby, as it was Sancho's design to cross it entirely and come out againat El Viso or Almodovar del Campo, and hide for some days among itscrags so as to escape the search of the Brotherhood should they come tolook for them. He was encouraged in this by perceiving that the stockof provisions carried by the ass had come safe out of the fray with thegalley slaves, a circumstance that he regarded as a miracle, seeing howthey pillaged and ransacked.c23c.jpg (297K)Full SizeThat night they reached the very heart of the Sierra Morena, where itseemed prudent to Sancho to pass the night and even some days, at leastas many as the stores he carried might last, and so they encampedbetween two rocks and among some cork trees; but fatal destiny, which,according to the opinion of those who have not the light of the truefaith, directs, arranges, and settles everything in its own way, soordered it that Gines de Pasamonte, the famous knave and thief who bythe virtue and madness of Don Quixote had been released from the chain,driven by fear of the Holy Brotherhood, which he had good reason todread, resolved to take hiding in the mountains; and his fate and fearled him to the same spot to which Don Quixote and Sancho Panza had beenled by theirs, just in time to recognise them and leave them to fallasleep: and as the wicked are always ungrateful, and necessity leads toevildoing, and immediate advantage overcomes all considerations of thefuture, Gines, who was neither grateful nor well-principled, made uphis mind to steal Sancho Panza's ass, not troubling himself aboutRocinante, as being a prize that was no good either to pledge or sell.While Sancho slept he stole his ass, and before day dawned he was farout of reach.c23d.jpg (256K)Full SizeAurora made her appearance bringing gladness to the earth but sadnessto Sancho Panza, for he found that his Dapple was missing, and seeinghimself bereft of him he began the saddest and most doleful lament inthe world, so loud that Don Quixote awoke at his exclamations and heardhim saying, "O son of my bowels, born in my very house, my children'splaything, my wife's joy, the envy of my neighbours, relief of myburdens, and lastly, half supporter of myself, for with thesix-and-twenty maravedis thou didst earn me daily I met half mycharges."Don Quixote, when he heard the lament and learned the cause, consoledSancho with the best arguments he could, entreating him to be patient,and promising to give him a letter of exchange ordering three out offive ass-colts that he had at home to be given to him. Sancho tookcomfort at this, dried his tears, suppressed his sobs, and returnedthanks for the kindness shown him by Don Quixote. He on his part wasrejoiced to the heart on entering the mountains, as they seemed to himto be just the place for the adventures he was in quest of. Theybrought back to his memory the marvellous adventures that had befallenknights-errant in like solitudes and wilds, and he went alongreflecting on these things, so absorbed and carried away by them thathe had no thought for anything else.c23e.jpg (280K)Full SizeNor had Sancho any other care (now that he fancied he was travelling ina safe quarter) than to satisfy his appetite with such remains as wereleft of the clerical spoils, and so he marched behind his master ladenwith what Dapple used to carry, emptying the sack and packing hispaunch, and so long as he could go that way, he would not have given afarthing to meet with another adventure.While so engaged he raised his eyes and saw that his master had halted,and was trying with the point of his pike to lift some bulky objectthat lay upon the ground, on which he hastened to join him and help himif it were needful, and reached him just as with the point of the pikehe was raising a saddle-pad with a valise attached to it, half orrather wholly rotten and torn; but so heavy were they that Sancho hadto help to take them up, and his master directed him to see what thevalise contained. Sancho did so with great alacrity, and though thevalise was secured by a chain and padlock, from its torn and rottencondition he was able to see its contents, which were four shirts offine holland, and other articles of linen no less curious than clean;and in a handkerchief he found a good lot of gold crowns, and as soonas he saw them he exclaimed:"Blessed be all Heaven for sending us an adventure that is good forsomething!"Searching further he found a little memorandum book richly bound; thisDon Quixote asked of him, telling him to take the money and keep it forhimself. Sancho kissed his hands for the favour, and cleared the valiseof its linen, which he stowed away in the provision sack. Consideringthe whole matter, Don Quixote observed:"It seems to me, Sancho--and it is impossible it can be otherwise--thatsome strayed traveller must have crossed this sierra and been attackedand slain by footpads, who brought him to this remote spot to buryhim.""That cannot be," answered Sancho, "because if they had been robbersthey would not have left this money.""Thou art right," said Don Quixote, "and I cannot guess or explain whatthis may mean; but stay; let us see if in this memorandum book there isanything written by which we may be able to trace out or discover whatwe want to know."He opened it, and the first thing he found in it, written roughly butin a very good hand, was a sonnet, and reading it aloud that Sanchomight hear it, he found that it ran as follows:SONNETOr Love is lacking in intelligence,Or to the height of cruelty attains,Or else it is my doom to suffer painsBeyond the measure due to my offence.But if Love be a God, it follows thenceThat he knows all, and certain it remainsNo God loves cruelty; then who ordainsThis penance that enthrals while it torments?It were a falsehood, Chloe, thee to name;Such evil with such goodness cannot live;And against Heaven I dare not charge the blame,I only know it is my fate to die.To him who knows not whence his maladyA miracle alone a cure can give.c23f.jpg (344K)Full Size"There is nothing to be learned from that rhyme," said Sancho, "unlessby that clue there's in it, one may draw out the ball of the wholematter.""What clue is there?" said Don Quixote."I thought your worship spoke of a clue in it," said Sancho."I only said Chloe," replied Don Quixote; "and that no doubt, is thename of the lady of whom the author of the sonnet complains; and,faith, he must be a tolerable poet, or I know little of the craft.""Then your worship understands rhyming too?""And better than thou thinkest," replied Don Quixote, "as thou shaltsee when thou carriest a letter written in verse from beginning to endto my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, for I would have thee know, Sancho,that all or most of the knights-errant in days of yore were greattroubadours and great musicians, for both of these accomplishments, ormore properly speaking gifts, are the peculiar property oflovers-errant: true it is that the verses of the knights of old havemore spirit than neatness in them.""Read more, your worship," said Sancho, "and you will find somethingthat will enlighten us."Don Quixote turned the page and said, "This is prose and seems to be aletter.""A correspondence letter, senor?""From the beginning it seems to be a love letter," replied Don Quixote."Then let your worship read it aloud," said Sancho, "for I am very fondof love matters.""With all my heart," said Don Quixote, and reading it aloud as Sanchohad requested him, he found it ran thus:Thy false promise and my sure misfortune carry me to a place whence thenews of my death will reach thy ears before the words of my complaint.Ungrateful one, thou hast rejected me for one more wealthy, but notmore worthy; but if virtue were esteemed wealth I should neither envythe fortunes of others nor weep for misfortunes of my own. What thybeauty raised up thy deeds have laid low; by it I believed thee to bean angel, by them I know thou art a woman. Peace be with thee who hastsent war to me, and Heaven grant that the deceit of thy husband be everhidden from thee, so that thou repent not of what thou hast done, and Ireap not a revenge I would not have.When he had finished the letter, Don Quixote said, "There is less to begathered from this than from the verses, except that he who wrote it issome rejected lover;" and turning over nearly all the pages of the bookhe found more verses and letters, some of which he could read, whileothers he could not; but they were all made up of complaints, laments,misgivings, desires and aversions, favours and rejections, somerapturous, some doleful. While Don Quixote examined the book, Sanchoexamined the valise, not leaving a corner in the whole of it or in thepad that he did not search, peer into, and explore, or seam that he didnot rip, or tuft of wool that he did not pick to pieces, lest anythingshould escape for want of care and pains; so keen was the covetousnessexcited in him by the discovery of the crowns, which amounted to near ahundred; and though he found no more booty, he held the blanketflights, balsam vomits, stake benedictions, carriers' fisticuffs,missing alforjas, stolen coat, and all the hunger, thirst, andweariness he had endured in the service of his good master, cheap atthe price; as he considered himself more than fully indemnified for allby the payment he received in the gift of the treasure-trove.The Knight of the Rueful Countenance was still very anxious to find outwho the owner of the valise could be, conjecturing from the sonnet andletter, from the money in gold, and from the fineness of the shirts,that he must be some lover of distinction whom the scorn and cruelty ofhis lady had driven to some desperate course; but as in thatuninhabited and rugged spot there was no one to be seen of whom hecould inquire, he saw nothing else for it but to push on, takingwhatever road Rocinante chose--which was where he could make hisway--firmly persuaded that among these wilds he could not fail to meetsome rare adventure. As he went along, then, occupied with thesethoughts, he perceived on the summit of a height that rose before theireyes a man who went springing from rock to rock and from tussock totussock with marvellous agility. As well as he could make out he wasunclad, with a thick black beard, long tangled hair, and bare legs andfeet, his thighs were covered by breeches apparently of tawny velvetbut so ragged that they showed his skin in several places.c23g.jpg (360K)Full SizeHe was bareheaded, and notwithstanding the swiftness with which hepassed as has been described, the Knight of the Rueful Countenanceobserved and noted all these trifles, and though he made the attempt,he was unable to follow him, for it was not granted to the feeblenessof Rocinante to make way over such rough ground, he being, moreover,slow-paced and sluggish by nature. Don Quixote at once came to theconclusion that this was the owner of the saddle-pad and of the valise,and made up his mind to go in search of him, even though he should haveto wander a year in those mountains before he found him, and so hedirected Sancho to take a short cut over one side of the mountain,while he himself went by the other, and perhaps by this means theymight light upon this man who had passed so quickly out of their sight."I could not do that," said Sancho, "for when I separate from yourworship fear at once lays hold of me, and assails me with all sorts ofpanics and fancies; and let what I now say be a notice that from thistime forth I am not going to stir a finger's width from your presence.""It shall be so," said he of the Rueful Countenance, "and I am veryglad that thou art willing to rely on my courage, which will never failthee, even though the soul in thy body fail thee; so come on now behindme slowly as well as thou canst, and make lanterns of thine eyes; letus make the circuit of this ridge; perhaps we shall light upon this manthat we saw, who no doubt is no other than the owner of what we found."To which Sancho made answer, "Far better would it be not to look forhim, for, if we find him, and he happens to be the owner of the money,it is plain I must restore it; it would be better, therefore, thatwithout taking this needless trouble, I should keep possession of ituntil in some other less meddlesome and officious way the real ownermay be discovered; and perhaps that will be when I shall have spent it,and then the king will hold me harmless.""Thou art wrong there, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "for now that we havea suspicion who the owner is, and have him almost before us, we arebound to seek him and make restitution; and if we do not see him, thestrong suspicion we have as to his being the owner makes us as guiltyas if he were so; and so, friend Sancho, let not our search for himgive thee any uneasiness, for if we find him it will relieve mine."And so saying he gave Rocinante the spur, and Sancho followed him onfoot and loaded, and after having partly made the circuit of themountain they found lying in a ravine, dead and half devoured by dogsand pecked by jackdaws, a mule saddled and bridled, all which stillfurther strengthened their suspicion that he who had fled was the ownerof the mule and the saddle-pad.c23h.jpg (381K)Full SizeAs they stood looking at it they heard a whistle like that of ashepherd watching his flock, and suddenly on their left there appeareda great number of goats and behind them on the summit of the mountainthe goatherd in charge of them, a man advanced in years. Don Quixotecalled aloud to him and begged him to come down to where they stood. Heshouted in return, asking what had brought them to that spot, seldom ornever trodden except by the feet of goats, or of the wolves and otherwild beasts that roamed around. Sancho in return bade him come down,and they would explain all to him.The goatherd descended, and reaching the place where Don Quixote stood,he said, "I will wager you are looking at that hack mule that lies deadin the hollow there, and, faith, it has been lying there now these sixmonths; tell me, have you come upon its master about here?""We have come upon nobody," answered Don Quixote, "nor on anythingexcept a saddle-pad and a little valise that we found not far fromthis.""I found it too," said the goatherd, "but I would not lift it nor gonear it for fear of some ill-luck or being charged with theft, for thedevil is crafty, and things rise up under one's feet to make one fallwithout knowing why or wherefore.""That's exactly what I say," said Sancho; "I found it too, and I wouldnot go within a stone's throw of it; there I left it, and there it liesjust as it was, for I don't want a dog with a bell.""Tell me, good man," said Don Quixote, "do you know who is the owner ofthis property?""All I can tell you," said the goatherd, "is that about six months ago,more or less, there arrived at a shepherd's hut three leagues, perhaps,away from this, a youth of well-bred appearance and manners, mounted onthat same mule which lies dead here, and with the same saddle-pad andvalise which you say you found and did not touch. He asked us what partof this sierra was the most rugged and retired; we told him that it waswhere we now are; and so in truth it is, for if you push on half aleague farther, perhaps you will not be able to find your way out; andI am wondering how you have managed to come here, for there is no roador path that leads to this spot. I say, then, that on hearing ouranswer the youth turned about and made for the place we pointed out tohim, leaving us all charmed with his good looks, and wondering at hisquestion and the haste with which we saw him depart in the direction ofthe sierra; and after that we saw him no more, until some daysafterwards he crossed the path of one of our shepherds, and withoutsaying a word to him, came up to him and gave him several cuffs andkicks, and then turned to the ass with our provisions and took all thebread and cheese it carried, and having done this made off back againinto the sierra with extraordinary swiftness. When some of us goatherdslearned this we went in search of him for about two days through themost remote portion of this sierra, at the end of which we found himlodged in the hollow of a large thick cork tree. He came out to meet uswith great gentleness, with his dress now torn and his face sodisfigured and burned by the sun, that we hardly recognised him butthat his clothes, though torn, convinced us, from the recollection wehad of them, that he was the person we were looking for. He saluted uscourteously, and in a few well-spoken words he told us not to wonder atseeing him going about in this guise, as it was binding upon him inorder that he might work out a penance which for his many sins had beenimposed upon him. We asked him to tell us who he was, but we were neverable to find out from him: we begged of him too, when he was in want offood, which he could not do without, to tell us where we should findhim, as we would bring it to him with all good-will and readiness; orif this were not to his taste, at least to come and ask it of us andnot take it by force from the shepherds. He thanked us for the offer,begged pardon for the late assault, and promised for the future to askit in God's name without offering violence to anybody. As for fixedabode, he said he had no other than that which chance offered wherevernight might overtake him; and his words ended in an outburst of weepingso bitter that we who listened to him must have been very stones had wenot joined him in it, comparing what we saw of him the first time withwhat we saw now; for, as I said, he was a graceful and gracious youth,and in his courteous and polished language showed himself to be of goodbirth and courtly breeding, and rustics as we were that listened tohim, even to our rusticity his gentle bearing sufficed to make itplain."But in the midst of his conversation he stopped and became silent,keeping his eyes fixed upon the ground for some time, during which westood still waiting anxiously to see what would come of thisabstraction; and with no little pity, for from his behaviour, nowstaring at the ground with fixed gaze and eyes wide open without movingan eyelid, again closing them, compressing his lips and raising hiseyebrows, we could perceive plainly that a fit of madness of some kindhad come upon him; and before long he showed that what we imagined wasthe truth, for he arose in a fury from the ground where he had thrownhimself, and attacked the first he found near him with such rage andfierceness that if we had not dragged him off him, he would have beatenor bitten him to death, all the while exclaiming, 'Oh faithlessFernando, here, here shalt thou pay the penalty of the wrong thou hastdone me; these hands shall tear out that heart of thine, abode anddwelling of all iniquity, but of deceit and fraud above all; and tothese he added other words all in effect upbraiding this Fernando andcharging him with treachery and faithlessness."We forced him to release his hold with no little difficulty, andwithout another word he left us, and rushing off plunged in among thesebrakes and brambles, so as to make it impossible for us to follow him;from this we suppose that madness comes upon him from time to time, andthat someone called Fernando must have done him a wrong of a grievousnature such as the condition to which it had brought him seemed toshow. All this has been since then confirmed on those occasions, andthey have been many, on which he has crossed our path, at one time tobeg the shepherds to give him some of the food they carry, at anotherto take it from them by force; for when there is a fit of madness uponhim, even though the shepherds offer it freely, he will not accept itbut snatches it from them by dint of blows; but when he is in hissenses he begs it for the love of God, courteously and civilly, andreceives it with many thanks and not a few tears. And to tell you thetruth, sirs," continued the goatherd, "it was yesterday that weresolved, I and four of the lads, two of them our servants, and theother two friends of mine, to go in search of him until we find him,and when we do to take him, whether by force or of his own consent, tothe town of Almodovar, which is eight leagues from this, and therestrive to cure him (if indeed his malady admits of a cure), or learnwhen he is in his senses who he is, and if he has relatives to whom wemay give notice of his misfortune. This, sirs, is all I can say inanswer to what you have asked me; and be sure that the owner of thearticles you found is he whom you saw pass by with such nimbleness andso naked."For Don Quixote had already described how he had seen the man gobounding along the mountainside, and he was now filled with amazementat what he heard from the goatherd, and more eager than ever todiscover who the unhappy madman was; and in his heart he resolved, ashe had done before, to search for him all over the mountain, notleaving a corner or cave unexamined until he had found him. But chancearranged matters better than he expected or hoped, for at that verymoment, in a gorge on the mountain that opened where they stood, theyouth he wished to find made his appearance, coming along talking tohimself in a way that would have been unintelligible near at hand, muchmore at a distance. His garb was what has been described, save that ashe drew near, Don Quixote perceived that a tattered doublet which hewore was amber-tanned, from which he concluded that one who wore suchgarments could not be of very low rank.Approaching them, the youth greeted them in a harsh and hoarse voicebut with great courtesy. Don Quixote returned his salutation with equalpoliteness, and dismounting from Rocinante advanced with well-bredbearing and grace to embrace him, and held him for some time close inhis arms as if he had known him for a long time. The other, whom we maycall the Ragged One of the Sorry Countenance, as Don Quixote was of theRueful, after submitting to the embrace pushed him back a little and,placing his hands on Don Quixote's shoulders, stood gazing at him as ifseeking to see whether he knew him, not less amazed, perhaps, at thesight of the face, figure, and armour of Don Quixote than Don Quixotewas at the sight of him. To be brief, the first to speak afterembracing was the Ragged One, and he said what will be told farther on.c23i.jpg (53K)Full SizeCHAPTER XXIV.IN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIERRA MORENAc24a.jpg (151K)Full SizeThe history relates that it was with the greatest attention Don Quixotelistened to the ragged knight of the Sierra, who began by saying:"Of a surety, senor, whoever you are, for I know you not, I thank youfor the proofs of kindness and courtesy you have shown me, and would Iwere in a condition to requite with something more than good-will thatwhich you have displayed towards me in the cordial reception you havegiven me; but my fate does not afford me any other means of returningkindnesses done me save the hearty desire to repay them.""Mine," replied Don Quixote, "is to be of service to you, so much sothat I had resolved not to quit these mountains until I had found you,and learned of you whether there is any kind of relief to be found forthat sorrow under which from the strangeness of your life you seem tolabour; and to search for you with all possible diligence, if searchhad been necessary. And if your misfortune should prove to be one ofthose that refuse admission to any sort of consolation, it was mypurpose to join you in lamenting and mourning over it, so far as Icould; for it is still some comfort in misfortune to find one who canfeel for it. And if my good intentions deserve to be acknowledged withany kind of courtesy, I entreat you, senor, by that which I perceiveyou possess in so high a degree, and likewise conjure you by whateveryou love or have loved best in life, to tell me who you are and thecause that has brought you to live or die in these solitudes like abrute beast, dwelling among them in a manner so foreign to yourcondition as your garb and appearance show. And I swear," added DonQuixote, "by the order of knighthood which I have received, and by myvocation of knight-errant, if you gratify me in this, to serve you withall the zeal my calling demands of me, either in relieving yourmisfortune if it admits of relief, or in joining you in lamenting it asI promised to do."The Knight of the Thicket, hearing him of the Rueful Countenance talkin this strain, did nothing but stare at him, and stare at him again,and again survey him from head to foot; and when he had thoroughlyexamined him, he said to him:"If you have anything to give me to eat, for God's sake give it me, andafter I have eaten I will do all you ask in acknowledgment of thegoodwill you have displayed towards me."Sancho from his sack, and the goatherd from his pouch, furnished theRagged One with the means of appeasing his hunger, and what they gavehim he ate like a half-witted being, so hastily that he took no timebetween mouthfuls, gorging rather than swallowing; and while he ateEND_STEGOII$I$H$I$?A$I`I$I$I  6$m6HiI$$I&&@$m6$H&@$@I Mo$@$i6mI$I$I$I$mm6IImmmII6m&MI6immi&Mmi$_mm'h$I$I$@$I$I }I$H$ I$I$I$mIim$I$I
