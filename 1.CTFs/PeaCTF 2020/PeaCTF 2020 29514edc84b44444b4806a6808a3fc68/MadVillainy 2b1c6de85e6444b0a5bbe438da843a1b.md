> An evil villain dubbed the “Triplet Lock” has recently been going around and messing with everyone’s audio files! A detective managed to find out his true identity but Triplet Lock was able to encrypt it before he was caught, can you find out what his true name is?
The flag starts with "Mr." and is case-insensitive.

1. This challenge took me a bit to figure out... its not very intuitive
2. After some trial and error, I realized I could reverse the audio and get something that sounded like it started with "Mr."

3. However, it was still to fast and deep to understand
    - I used this site to edit the pitch and speed

    - .8 speed and 9 semitones sounded good
4. Sounds like Mr. Heartwall? That didn't work though... so I looked up "encryption" along with "Heartwall" in the hopes that the names had to relate. Looks like Hartwell was the name
5. The flag is Mr.Hartwell
