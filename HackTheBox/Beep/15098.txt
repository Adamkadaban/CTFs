CVE: CVE-2010-3490

Finding:
The configuration interface for FreePBX is prone to a remote arbitrary code
execution on the system recordings menu. FreePBX doesn't handle file uploads
in a secure manner, allowing an attacker to manipulate the file extension
and the beginning of the uploaded file name.

The piece of code below, found in page.recordings.php, illustrates part of
the recordings upload feature.

/* Code removed to fit better on advisory */

<?php
  if (isset($_FILES['ivrfile']['tmp_name']) &&
  is_uploaded_file($_FILES['ivrfile']['tmp_name'])) {
    if (empty($usersnum)) {
      $dest = "unnumbered-";
    } else {
      $dest = "{$usersnum}-";
    }
    $suffix = substr(strrchr($_FILES['ivrfile']['name'], "."), 1);
    $destfilename = $recordings_save_path.$dest."ivrrecording.".$suffix;
    move_uploaded_file($_FILES['ivrfile']['tmp_name'], $destfilename);
    echo "<h6>"._("Successfully uploaded")."
      ".$_FILES['ivrfile']['name']."</h6>";
    $rname = rtrim(basename($_FILES['ivrfile']['name'], $suffix), '.');
  } ?>

/* Code removed to fit better on advisory */

When a file is uploaded, a copy is saved temporarily under the /tmp/
directory, where the name of the file is composed of
user-controlled-staticname.extension, where:

"user-controlled" is $usersnum variable.
"staticname" value is -ivrrecording.
"extension" is controlled by the user.

If $usersnum variable is not defined, then a static string (unnumbered)
is used.

Finally, when the user clicks on the save button on the System Recordings
interface, the file is saved with the original file name provided by the
user under the /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/custom/ directory.

When uploading a file, an attacker can manipulate the $usersnum variable to
perform a path traversal attack and save it anyplace that the web server
user has access, for example the Apache's DocumentRoot. This allows an
attacker to upload malicious code to the web server and execute it under the
webserver's access permissions.

The HTTP request below illustrates the upload of a phpshell.
